A5RHZE7B8SV5Q,1078531200,The best mature Men's magazine.,"There's nothing to say, but if you want a REAL men's magazine, this is it. They have great articles and stories, and I love the bits of knowledge that starts the Know & Tell section, and I love the last page, which has an interview with a celebrity. Just get this magazine and forget all the other mature men's mags.",1

A1IU9VPCBKZPE8,1286236800,Excellent Computer Magazine,"When PC Magazine ceased publication of their paper magazine, I began to look for a replacement, and I found it in this magazine. This magazine covers the latest information in the field of computers and related technology. Some of my favorite sections are:<br /><br />White paper - In this section a technology is explained. For example, in the last issue I read how AES secures your data.<br /><br />Doctor - This section answers user questions. I always seem to find some very useful information here.<br /><br />Features - Presents feature articles on timely subjects.<br /><br />News - Presents the latest news in the field.<br /><br />Reviews - Here the magazine reviews various tech gear and rates them with a rating system from one to ten.<br /><br />Overall, I have been pleased with the coverage of the computer field that this magazine presents.",1
AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,1224547200,A toned down GQ / Esquire,Details is much less indepth / informative as GQ or Esquire.  The articles are shorter in length and not as journalistic. Articles are more about lifestyles and less about sports / women and cars.  With reveiews that are typically a few paragraphs long.  The magazine itselfs seems geared towards a younger male and a more metrosexual lifestyle. The price is right and for $10 it a great investment as you most likely find a few things each month of interest.,1
A3OIE7IE9LTPJG,1235520000,Best PC Magazine,"In my mind BEST PC Magazine for upgrades / hardware info, tips . tricks, etc. Great Price",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1142380800,Give Me the Details,"Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.<br /><br />Some things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the ""departments"". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being ""Know- Tell"" and the ""The Details""). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.<br /><br />As far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.<br /><br />I like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads ""Is Your Wife a Bad Mom""? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.<br /><br />The writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.<br /><br />Besides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the ""Anthropology"" page at the end. This closing ""article"" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what ""Anthropology"" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question ""Gay or ______"". For example, I have seen titles like ""Gay or Best Friends?"", ""Gay or Cowboy?"", ""Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?"", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.<br /><br />Advertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.<br /><br />Overall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It's all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1190592000,Maximizing Electronics Enjoyment,"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.<br /><br />When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.<br /><br />One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.<br /><br />Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.",1
A5RHZE7B8SV5Q,1078790400,More like half and half PC and BS.,"Maximum PC's slogan is Maximum PC. Minimum BS. Well I think they should make that, Half PC. Half BS. If you buy your subscription on here, you're not getting the CD, which is obviously, the whole essence of the mag. The CD is done just like PC Gamer, but it just has Maximum PC on there, instead of PC Gamer, and this also means, if your PCG CD's won't auto-load, neither will the MPC ones. Since I can't see what the price is for the subscription on here, I cant tell if you're paying the same amount on here for the no CD sub, as you would with the CD. CD sub. price is $29.95. You can obviously look at the top of the page, and see what the price is. The one good thing they have is the Head 2 Head thing they have in the beginning, where they pit two products against each other. This month it was Yahoo! Mail vs. Hotmail. So this really isn't a great magazine, nor a good PC magazine (no pun). If you want a real independent magazine, go with PC Magazine. (And for more on that, read my review...if it ever gets posted).",0

AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,1066348800,cluttered but nice,"This magazine has a lower cover price than some of its competitors, and makes up for it with a massive amount of ads. A few ads contain coupons, for those that like to cut those little things out (unfortunately they are hardly ever for anything I want !). The paper is also a lot thinner than the higher priced home/garden publications, and the photographs do not reproduce that well on it.<br />On the bright side, there are many nice d&eacute;cor ideas, and simply terrific recipes.<br />Taking the October 2003 edition as an example, Fall colors and produce are the theme. It has some ideas on how to display gourds, and an article on a community pumpkin patch, from the June planting by 140 neighbors and friends in a 6000 square ft. area, to harvest time.<br />There are numerous articles on remodeling, ""Foolproof Potted Plants"", on the joys of having hardy succulents in your home, and a lovely piece with lots of photographs on actor Peter Strauss' gorgeous Ojai, California garden.<br />The best article of all, is ""The Magic of Soup"", and some of these recipes are so good they might end up in your family for generations. They are simple to prepare, with easy to find ingredients, and will make a healthy, hearty meal for those frosty days ahead. Also included with the recipes is the preparation and cooking time, and nutritional statistics.<br />As someone who writes a lot of notes and cards, I appreciate the final page which is about letter writing, and how this vanishing form of communicating is good for the soul.<br />All things considered, this magazine gives good value, and is meant for those of us who do not live in a mansion or have hours to devote to a single recipe.",1

With a focus on friends and family, gardening, interior design, building, family matters, flood, good health and shopping, you can't go wrong!<br /><br />I like the ""Yours for the Asking"" section where you can send away a postcard for more information instead of contacting each company.<br /><br />For mom's, the ""kids project"" section will be amusing and your kids will love the ideas.<br /><br />The cartoons are also cute and I had to laugh at the one that said: ""Of course I love you. Didn't you get my fax?""<br /><br />Something about the pictures in this magazine always remind me of a bright sunny day. The open kitchens and lush gardens are just a treat to see.<br /><br />The recipe section really has a personality all of its own. The ""Petite Caramel Apple"" recipe they had in the September 2001 issue was so adorable!<br /><br />I look forward to every issue!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

A1JZFGZEZVWQPY,1434326400,Mens Health,"This is not a perfect magazine. For one, I was a charter subscriber when it first came out. I get the print and iPad edition. That has been awhile. While I have gotten older the magazine has stayed stuck at the same age. While I am now in an older demographic that its numbers are huge, it is pretty much ignored now.<br />Surely I am not the only fifty year old guy in good shape, or who is interested in being and staying that way. Maybe a mens health plus.<br />Anyway you get used to that sort of thing. One reviewer said all you need is one year of this magazine and it will cover everything. That could be true sort of, but I like it for the ideas, motivation, and it has some really cool food stuff, and recipes.<br />I get mens health, and I got womens health for the misses. The stories and info do not overlap. Most times I find womens health a better magazine. Womens health also suffers from the agest problem. They think their readers don't get older. If they follow their magazines fitness programs they should get older.. right?",1

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292198400,The Periodical of Lists and Little Else,"Bottom-Line: I have come to the conclusion the ""Men's Health"" is not written for me.<br /><br />The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Men's Health"" magazine stands out as a periodical with some substance, style and intellect, but after reading the latest issue I am certainly not sold.  And what is with all of the lists?<br /><br />I had been meaning to pick up an issue of ""Men's Health Magazine"" for quite some time when I picked up a copy--the October 2007 issue--while shopping for a computer manual at Borders.  The cover--as they always tend to do--featured a rather buff Jason Statham and article titles in big bold letters designed to catch the attention of that man looking for advise on Six-Pack ABS, or how to Dress for More Sex, or how to Eat Better and Think Smarter, or (my favorite) read what 1,293 Sexy Women Confess What They Want in Bed.<br /><br />""Men's Health Magazine,"" whose tag line is Tons of Useful Stuff, was founded in 1987 and is published 10 times a year by the Rodale Inc.  The magazine began publishing in the United Kingdom in 1995.  Today ""Men's Health Magazine"" is published in 36 editions worldwide, distributed to 48 countries, and enjoyed a (2005) U.S. circulation of some 1.8 million.<br /><br />The problem with ""Men's Health"" is that there is very little useful information to be found with the fold of the magazine despite it daunting size.  Most of the articles are snippets of information stuck between far too many glassy advertisements featuring young male models in clothing I would never wear and probably couldn't afford.  Same for the automobiles.  To be sure there was one rather lengthy article in the issue I read, but it was about dogs of all things!  The article I wanted to have some substance--a snippet on Michelle Ryan, the new Bionic Woman--was barely a page in length; how disappointing.<br /><br />And yes there was a snippet or two about healthy food, but nothing I didn't already know.  And the lists, there are endless lists of thing we can do to improve this or that, mostly dealing with self-image and sex; there are very few actually devoted to well, men's health.  Has our attention span grown so short that we must now condense or leisure reading into bullet points; endless lists that tell us how to live our lives?<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion the ""Men's Health"" is not written for me, a man in the middle of his life, settled, with a family, a regular job, with far too little time work workout, and far too little money to afford the rich life-style pimped by the magazine.  There is little practical information inside the glossy innards of ""Men's Health"" at least from my perspective.  Perhaps if I were young, rich, hip, the magazine would appeal to me, but I am none of those things, so...By the way what is the deal with all the lists?  Oh I already asked that question, I am still waiting for an answer.",0

Well, 52 maybe.<br /><br />But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH.<br /><br />It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs.<br /><br />To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS.<br /><br />In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, well, there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you.<br /><br />Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either.<br /><br />I kind of like it.",1

Some of these mags are indistinguishable to me.)<br /><br />Ok, I do cook a lot, but my hubby is gluten free so a lot of the recipes are unusable, or need modification.<br /><br />Like all other ""home"" mags it's very consumer-driven. Buy this new cleaner/foundation/moisturizer. Buy these new rugs/lamps/sofas. Buy these backpacks/storage cubes/clothes that are trending now for your kids. Buy, buy, buy. I find this very off-putting. Even  the ""budget"" room remodels (furniture replacement) usually have ridiculously priced rugs, lamps, or chairs that I can't ever imagine buying.<br /><br />There are articles on handling family, financial, and social issues, party planning, etc as you would expect. It is very current, with discussions of sex (though not as frank as Redbook is), social media, and other issues.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are a modern mom with some disposable income trying to ""do it all and look fabulous"" this is probably right for you. For me, no kids, not so youth-driven, seldom entertain, it's not that interesting.<br /><br />One thing this mag has over others in the Good Housekeeping Seal.

A1KXONFPU2XQ5K,1012176000,Interesting Local Reading,"I have somewhat mixed feelings about this magazine, as I can not tell to what type of audience this is truly meant for.  The articles are hard hitting, and well written.  I can not dispute that.  Sometimes I simply don't find them all that interesting. I enjoy the restaurant reviews, its helpful knowing of a few good suggestions when traveling, or even locally.  I find the advertising in the magazine to be a bid auspicious as it seems to cater only to those high members of society that are in serious need of spa treatments and an occasional face lift.  Maybe its tough finding advertising, but I find that it takes away from articles about our local government and issues.<br />I do feel this is totally worth the subscription price, and you are bound to find 12 dollars of reading in a years time :)  This might even be a good gift idea from someone that is no longer in the area.",1

A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,1085356800,The Best Overall Travel Magazine I Have Found,"I think that in terms of overall content presented, 'Conde Nast Traveler' is the best travel magazine currently on the market. Some other reviewers have raised some valid points concerning article length, and bias toward upscale properties. I think that there are other magazines that might be more suitable for others, including 'Budget Travel' and 'National Geographic Traveler', both of which I also subscribe to and enjoy, though they both have their limitations and issues as well.<br />So what sets 'Conde Nast' apart? I think it is the willingness to find new and exciting vacation destinations that are still reasonable enough to get to as to make them worthwhile to a large audience. Some of the more exotic magazines have great articles on hiking in Tibet and the like, but how many people are really able to do that (or can afford to do it?) My point is that although it is by no means perfect, I think the editors and writers do consciously strike a balance between the too mundane and too exotic (and expensive) and attempt to focus the majority of the magazine in that area.<br />This is just too good of a magazine to pass up. The 'Deals of the Month' section alone justifies the price. Of all the travel magazines I read on a monthly basis (currently four) 'Conde Nast Traveler' is my favorite and I highly recommend it.",1

I don't find it to be on the ""high end"" I think they have enough information in each issue for everyone. I also agree with what one of my fellow reviewers stated this magazine hasn't been bogged down with advertisements yet, so therefore you are definately getting enough articles, reports, money saving tips and reader comments to fill up these pages.<br />It is well worth the money and I have renewed twice now.... and that coming from someone who is VERY selective of what Magazine publications come to my door is a HUGE Compliment.<br />Respectfully Reviewed",1

A35W3JQYP0M655,1296432000,A Subscription To Ads,"I started receiving Better Homes (BH) last year sometime as a free subscription.  I never signed up for it or sent anything in, it just started arriving on a free trial basis for about 6 months.  BH is not something I would normally think of subscribing too, but for free, I thought why not.  However it wasn't long before the magazine would arrive in the mail and it would either be flipped through for a couple of minutes and then trashed, or just trashed outright.  It truly was that uninteresting to me. I subscribe to about 4 other magazines and this is the only one I didn't think was worth it, even for free.  The magazine is thick and heavy, but its all Ads.  I mean this magazine starts out with 20 pages of Ads before you even get to the table of contents.  The other reviewer here that talked about it being aggravating the way you have to navigate through all the ADs, cards, and other offers to find the few articles that there are is absolutely right.  A 3 page article can be spread out over a dozen pages just because of the Ads.  The price of this magazine is certainly cheap enough.  On the surface it appears a downright bargain.  But the whole saying about getting what you pay for applies here for sure.  For some folks it may still be worth it of they happen to be the type that enjoy looking at and reading a bunch of glossy Ads.  If you're one of those types,BH is right up your alley.  For the rest of us that enjoy genuine articles and less fanfare, my suggestion is pass up Better Homes...",0

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1324598400,Texas Monthly Keeps You Up to Speed with the Lone Star State,"Texas Monthly Magazine is a magazine about a state, its places, and its people. This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.<br /><br />Going back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.<br /><br />Texas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well.",1

A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,1306022400,Fabulous for Vacation Dreaming; another point of view,"It's important to understand that this magazine isn't about budget travel.  It's for people who travel for business, where a corporation is paying, and for those who can afford to travel luxuriously for pleasure, at least occasionally.  I love reading about exotic destinations, the top spas and bath experiences in the world, and amazing travel experiences.  It has gorgeous photography, interesting articles, and solid information.  Even if I can't afford to take trips like this every year, I still want to read about them.  If I'm going to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip I'll want to know just where to say and what to do.  When I went<br />to Florida I stayed in budget places except for the last night, when we went to the Hotel Fontainebleau on Miami Beach, which was wonderful.  It's important to know and decide when to save money and when it's worth it to splurge.<br /><br />I almost gave my subscription up because with physical disabilities it's unlikely I can do a lot of travel.  But I still want to dream about it.  I'd love a travel magazine that included information about vacation travel ideas for those of us who can't walk or stand for hours.  So many travel articles urge the traveler to get out and walk, but that isn't possible for all of us.  Conde Nast is a lot less likely to urge long impossible hikes on me than National Geographic Traveler.",1

AEMZRE6QYVQBS,1168732800,see the world without getting bruised by it,"At the risk of inverting priorities, let me begin this review with a word of disclosure about the reviewer:<br /><br />I love travel, am on the road half the time for professional reasons, travel to all the continents, have lived on three of them for extended periods of time, and nurture a quiet reservation about people who 'get to know' faraway places by the convenience of a short visit to an affluent resort.<br /><br />However, I have also seen both the good that tourism has done for local economies and the blinkered understanding of the world too often suffered by those who cannot or choose not to travel. So my reluctance should not be construed as resentment.<br /><br />OK, enough of that. Given these caveats about high-end travel, Cond Nast can be a fascinating read. Some of it ('Escape from the Airport. Passenger power saves the day', Dec 2006) is valuable for air travelers on almost any budget.<br /><br />Yet the *real* value of this magazine will be mined by those whose circumstances allow them to travel anywhere they want. For that kind of affluent tourist, Cond Nast can be a gold mine of opportunities that would otherwise be overlooked.<br /><br />In my judgement, TRAVEL AND LEISURE beats CONDE NAST TRAVELER by a nose in this sector's competition, but either one will do you. If you had, say, five years of high-end travel in front of you, you'd do well to toss in some coins for subscriptions to both.<br /><br />Frequent travelers on a business or economy budget are likely to hold out for browsing in the dentist office waiting room or - as I do - snagging subscriptions to both via frequent flyer miles.<br /><br />Bon voyage!",1

A2WLJW6XSIDJTT,1363564800,The Family Handyman,I subscribe to this magazine for my husband and both of our sons.  I also read it each month when it arrives because I like to have a general knowledge of home maintenance.  They all read more in depth. The service however was terrible. I finally canceled it because they couldn't get it right. One month we received 3 copies of the same issue.,1
A3O72Q4RRYY87C,1331596800,Good Read!,"At first I didn't like this magazine at all, and then I decided to give it another try, and I'm glad I did. This is not a magazine to read quickly. It's not jam packed with pictures and how to's etc... and big bold text. The text can be long and there are lots of smaller images - ie treasures tucked inside that if you skim it quickly you will miss. If you are inspired by images of others' works, you will enjoy this read! If you want something you can just look at the pictures and be inspired - probably not for you.",1
A33AQPJYH7UUXR,1327017600,not particularly inspiring,"I recently ordered several magazines when Amazon had the five dollar per year promotion going. I had enjoyed this magazine in the past as a once in a while pick at the bookstore. I've just received my first issue and found that it seems very ""light"" on decorator content. Personally I agree with some of the less flattering reviews of this magazine that the articles can get lost with the ads.<br /><br />It almost seems as if they used a very budget template to create the article layout. Also the feel of what they are covering seems so spare that even catalogs seem more ""homey"" than the homes they featured. Struck me as odd that *all* the homes they featured seemed like the set designer was only about 60% done with dressing the shoot. Looked like someone was just moving in and had not finished adding those touches that make it special. Just my opinion....<br /><br />For five dollars I won't complain too hard but if the first issue is any indication of what to expect I probably would not renew this one. In fairness it has only been one issue though and over the course of the year if things change, I'll revise this review accordingly.",1

Food: ""Fruit Under Fire"", a luscious collection of recipes for grilled fruit, with close-up illustrations that are enough to stir up the appetite.<br />Every issue will spark some ideas on how to enhance your surroundings, how to buy on a budget, how to experiment by mixing styles, and much more.

A1RPTVW5VEOSI,1421193600,A shadow of the old PS,"When I was a little kid, in the late 50s and early 60s, one of my greatest treasures was the massive stack of Popular Science magazines my father had accumulated in the basement. They were a treasure trove of science stories, how-to articles, projects, and more. Over the years the magazine changed, but for decades it was still a great favorite.  Recently I resubscribed, thanks to a cheap offer, and while I expected that PS, like most other magazines, would have shrunk somewhat in size, I wasn't quite prepared for this. What I received was a thin brochure with articles so short and with so little depth that I'd finished the magazine and tossed it into the recycling bin before half and hour had gone by.<br /><br />What was there in the magazine was interesting, as far as it went, but it just didn't go very far. Most articles were no more than a page or two long- and not terribly different from what you'll find on their web page. It's sad to see the magazine go, but I suppose it's really though no fault of the writers who create it. In an era of immediate information distribution, increasing printing and mailing costs,  and dynamic web content, there just isn't a place for a magazine like the old Popular Science anymore.",1

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292284800,This Magazine Must Keep the Paparazzi (All of Them) Employed,"Bottom-line: While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.<br /><br />The New Year brought a new commitment to fitness; Yeah!  But no, this time I'm serious about want to shed a few pounds and lighten the load on my poor knees.  Of course this mean a copious amount of time on the treadmill shedding those unwanted pound, listening to Christina Aguilera and reading ""US Weekly Magazine,"" which my gym seems to have an over abundance of to the exclusion of any other periodical.<br /><br />I am not usually given to reading entertainment magazines; I would hate to think of myself as a celebrity hound, but ""US Weekly"" is short on words and long on pictures and advertising; in other words just right for the treadmill machine where my attention is not ripe for reading.  Unlike Entertainment Weekly, or even People, ""US Weekly"" does not pretend to be serious, the magazine does not attempt to cloth itself in the veneer of serious journalism.  ""US Weekly"", which is published, well weekly, is little more than a thin picture book full of the minutiae of celebrity life.<br /><br />There are no articles in ""US Weekly"", at least not anything that would pass as an article in say Entertainment Weekly, or People; there are instead picture captions and the occasion short write-up (a paragraph or two) on this star or that, or those stars over there.  ""US Weekly"" is just a tad more reputable than say The National Enquirer or Star Magazine, but just barely.  For example, the February 19, 2007 issues' cover featured a colorful full page picture of Reese Witherspoon beside a headline that read Hollywood's Revenge Diets! Better after breakup!  How newly single stars get slim and sexy fast.  Meanwhile a sidebar featured Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson under a title which read Plastic Surgery!  Jennifer was a ""Winner!"" while poor Jessica was ""Scary!"" after her sojourn under the knife.<br /><br />Regular sections in the magazine include:<br /><br />o Hot Hollywood<br />o Hot Pics<br />o Features<br />o News<br />o Style<br />o In Every Issue<br /><br />But lack of depth does not prevent the mainstream advertisers from calling; indeed there is an advertisement--mostly courting a female audience--almost every other page.  This is not out of line with other magazines in this genre, although ""US Weekly"" is the only magazine I know of that does not have a masthead.  Based on the advertising and editorial content this is a magazine designed and published for young women.  And that is not to imply that young women are shallow and unfocused on self; I make the statement because there are a lot of (female) style and fashion photos contained therein, along with a fair amount of make-up advertisements.  This is not normally (straight) ""guy"" territory.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.  And while I have to admit that (women) celebrities intrigue me, I would rather not read a whole magazine devoted to their every step; ""US Weekly"" is not for me.",1

AOR590VF8YI5J,1097107200,"Entertaining, but..........","US Weekly is a mix of a tabloid and a fashion magazine, though it is a bit better at telling the truth than some other magazines *ahem*. It's one of those magazines that will come into great use when you're bored and want something interesting yet light to read, and if you're celebrity obsessed, you'll definitely LOVE this one. My main problem with it is that everytime I pick up an issue, I feel like I'm stalking these celebs. In their August 30 issue, they had a two-page spread showing Jessica Simpson shopping at a grocery store, loading them into her car, and even pulling her dress back up. I don't know about you, but I felt as though that was completely unnescesary. The magazine is big on these things, like showing Britney Spears eating lunch and Paris and Nikki Hilton walking on the beach. It gets very annoying sometimes. However, some of the stuff they talk about is interesting, and I enjoy the fashion and beauty sections. But if you're one of those who can't live without the latest celebrity gossip and news, this would be a great magazine for you.",1
AXFI7TAWD6H6X,1064361600,A guilty pleasure of mine,"I am not really big on celebrity magazines that are really tabloids but with glossy pages like People magazine but I must admit to having a soft spot for US Weekly. Yeah it is pure fluff and nothing to be taken remotely seriously however I get my kicks out of some of the articles that are published there. My biggest beef with the rag is that in the latest issue of US Weekly, it only gives a paragraph each to the passings of Johnny Cash and John Ritter who had passed away two weeks ago while they do an entire bloody article on Bennifer Afflopez, the most overexposed and overrated celebrity couple on this entire planet. I found that quite distasteful. Even that tabloid People Magazine gave a couple of pages to both celebrities. What is just as gross is seeing really unattractive celebs in their bathing suits (i.e Avril Lavigne and her guitar player). However I do love the best & worst dressed pages in the back. I love the snide remarks from the weekly guests. I don't care who is the best dressed, it is who is wearing the ugliest outfits that I care. Another celebrity couple I could live without seeing in the pages of US Weekly for the rest of my life...Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. Oh lordy. The two most boring celebrities known to mankind. And their acting isn't anything to write home about either. If anything, US Weekly makes for good reading material in the bathroom, otherwise it ain't serious journalism that's for sure.",1
A26KYDJOAGI05S,1056412800,Trendy Tabloid,"Us weekly is mostly about what the stars are wearing and the latest trend on television.

The articles are all really short and definitely without much depth, but most people aren't looking for that when they read Us weekly.  The fashion police is pretty funny; it's just a bunch of comments about star's clothes from a group of people with no real authority on the subject.  Most are comedians or writers, which is probably why it's so funny.  This magazine is definitely a quick read, and I don't feel any smarter when I'm done reading it, but it does keep me up to date on the Hollywood side of pop culture.",1

A26KYDJOAGI05S,1038960000,Fashion Advertisements,"This magazine has excellent fashion photography.  Mostly this is in the form of advertisements, which take up the first 175 pages and many more throughout.  The pages are almost twice the size of a standard magazine, which leaves room for more artistic ads.  The articles, I find hard to relate to or take seriously.  To me, they seem more like tabloid tales of sordid love affairs and over-hyped parties than any kind of actual informative articles.  For a magazine that is touted as a fashion industry standard, I expected to see many more articles about fashion, styles, and designers rather than Hollywood gossip.  The photographs and fashion advertisements really are great, and I believe they would be the most useful aspect of this magazine for people interested in fashion.",1

A1TFOXCKW4JHIB,1013990400,The best personal finance mag out there,"I have been a subscriber for 5 or 6 years now and I always find each issue to be valuable.  SmartMoney strikes a good balance between investment advice/coverage and information/articles that deal with the other aspects of your financial life.  Among the features I look forward to every month:<br />- Ten Things:  a ""watch out"" list of 10 things that you should know about the different professionals you interact with (your dentist, your accountant, a real estate broker, etc.).  Always an eye-opener.<br />- Stock Screen:  Paul Sturm is a knowledgeable, value-oriented journalist who puts together a list each month of 8-10 stocks that make it through a rigid screen of several characteristics.  Each month, he features a different screen and he uses a good mix of quantitative characteristics and common sense to generate the list.<br />- Feature articles that profile common people and the serious personal finance problems they have endured (e.g., collecting on insurance, fighting the IRS, traveling overseas).<br />SmartMoney is frequently compared to Money magazine, but Money is often more narrowly focused on investing and it sometimes dumbs down its articles.  I also read BusinessWeek, Forbes and Fortune regularly.  While they all have their place, none provides the depth and common sense focus of SmartMoney when it comes to personal finance.  I have photocopied and saved countless articles and I sometimes refer to them years later.  ...  my advice is to get a subscription now - it's definitely worth it.",1

A3BVRA2QL3TIOQ,1108598400,A Highly Sought After Collectible,"If it is in Vogue, it IS in fashion! This magazine, which has existed since 1892, is one of the premier magazines for women. It is an American magazine, but also has Australian, Brazilian, British, French, German, Italian, and Spanish Editions. It covers fashion, beauty, health, fitness, celebrities, movies, art, and other topics of interest to women. Vogue is mainly directed at the Jet-Set, but anyone will find its pages both entertaining, and informative. I have a subscription to it, and I collect it on the basis of its collectibility. Mine arrive in clear plastic bags, which are never opened (unless of course one of my favorite celebritie's is on the cover). I wish all magazine publishers used the clear bag method of shipping, because an subscription label directly on the cover of a magazine is frowned upon by most collectors. So unless you buy it right off the shelf, or it is bagged, most collectors will not be interested in it. Getting back to Vogue, if you want to keep up with what is IN in fashion, this is the magazine to have. You know those $1,000 dresses you've heard about? You'll find many of them modeled in here! Fashions photographed by some of the world's most renowned photographers, are featured in the magazine.

It's consistently prescient in its speculation ... the management keeps a tidy score.

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1184198400,Smart Money Combines Business and Personal Finance,"Smart Money is a solid magazine about business and finance and I have been reading it on and off again for the past five years. This magazine is a little bit big business and a little bit personal finance, combining together the features of a business magazine with that of an investment publication.<br /><br />One of the main things I like about Smart Money is the fact that it includes so many different articles each month. There are only a few regular departments in this magazine. The majority of the pages include featured articles and short articles that change from month to month. These articles can cover a wide range of topics from ways to cut your electric bill to the latest regulations in the insurance industry.<br /><br />Smart Money is an intelligent magazine and its articles are often a little more advanced than those of other financial publications. They don't reach a level that is too advanced to make them incapable of understanding, and that is good. But they are certainly intended for the savvier investor who already knows the ropes and wants some more specific, intermediate to advanced advice on personal finance and corporate happenings.<br /><br />Overall, I rank Smart Money as a very good personal finance magazine and it is one I will continue to read when I get the chance. It is like a combination of Fortune and Money magazines and its timely articles are often very interesting and helpful. Whether it's an article on reducing your cell phone bill or an article about the profit picture in the oil business, Smart Money is certain to inform and enlighten.",1

One feature had garish clothes on models posed in front of small suburban houses...how quaint.  Another ""fashion"" spread had a young woman being kidnapped, a bag put over her head, handcuffed, and finally posed nude facing a wall.  Degrading and violent sexualized images of women.  That's not fashion...it's pornography.<br /><br />This magazine might appeal to older people who came of age in the 1960s (plastic surgery article, gaudy jewelry ads) who ""celebrate"" the sexual revolution and don't think much of the dignity of the human body.<br /><br />I can't see this magazine staying in existence much longer.",0

But the ads are helpful to the reader because they often include bargain prices. There are also classified ads from other readers who have island vacation property to rent.<br />If you like to travel and you love water, then Islands magazine is a great publication to read.

Each thick issue was full of articles on everything from the latest scientific breakthroughs to gadgets you could build in your basement shop. They commissioned vacation home designs from architects, told you how to build a radio, and helped you maintain your car (anyone remember Smokey's Garage?)<br /><br />Today's PopSci is 90 pages of brief essays, and there's nothing here you can't find by browsing a few web pages like Engadget, Science Daily, and yes, PopSci's own website. Instructables has more projects than you'll find a a year of PS.<br /><br />But that's the way the world is going.

About half the pages contain editorial material, but there's precious little information.there are, however, several full-page portraits of the subjects of a few of the articles, and a double page spread of Neil DeGrasse Tyson in a rubber apron with a goofy look.

What I can appreciate about this magazine that it is slightly more less high end than its rival ""Bon Appetit"" which I think over the years has become more geared to the snobby food lover than to those who live on a budget. There are still quite a bit of recipes that are quite fancy but there seems to be a good number of recipes that are simple and basic, not to mention affordable for those on a budget and aren't concerned with the presentation of the dish.

Some of the most delicious morsels of the month are on this page.<br />If one has the time to spend creating these gastronomic delights, it is well worth it.

That being said, I just ignore them unless I'm in the market for products.<br /><br />The magazine also has good Reviews, a wide range of ""How To"" features, and well written articles.

Wired covers a wide range of interests including technical inovations in medical, bio-engineering, computers, imaging, etc. Also covers artistic and political issues as well.<br /><br />The writing is a bit hit and miss, but there is generally enough content that there is something worth reading in every issue. The gadget reviews alone do it for me.<br /><br />At the low subscription price, this is a real value. Recommended!",1

Unlike alot of my magazines that 40% of the content is adds there are few adds and lots of info in Wired.  The stories are not all tech and nerdy like the title might suggest.  I do skip a few pages here and there because the content does not interest me but for the most part i enjoy every page and find the articles to be well written.  This is a great gift for under $10,1

I like that this magazine is constantly fresh and doesn't seem to get stales.  There are always great articles about what is new and upcoming in techonology, new trends on the Internet.  Some magazines have a lot of filler and tend to be a vehicle for selling advertisements.<br /><br />What makes Wired extra special is that they don't pander to products that they do advertising for.  Unlike other computer related magazines they write about trends, and outstanding products.  This leaves them more room for good reporting and less veiled advertising.  They often feature articles written by famous people in techonology.<br /><br />I have operated a cooking website since 1995, so I am familar with the Internet, and how it works.  What I like about Wired magazine is that they constantly write about what's new and upcoming in trends for the online world, and they tend to be very on the mark with where the Internet is and where it is going.<br /><br />If you are interested in techonology, and what is going on online this is the magazine for you.  Wired magazine is fresh, and is free of pandering to the products they help advertise.  I like that this magazine is high on content and low in advertisements.  Always fresh content about new products in techonology, trends in the high tech world, and a good insight on the Internet make this magazine an excellent choice.",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1163548800,Wired for the Modern World,"Wired is a semi- interesting magazine that blends together articles about technology with those on politics, culture, and more. This magazine is aimed at a diverse audience but it generally caters to those who are technology savvy and like to keep up with the latest world events.<br /><br />Wired dedicates most of its pages to the discussion of electronics and other technology and computer nerds form a large percentage of the magazine's core subscribers. Articles about digital cameras, high definition televisions, internet marketing, and other like topics can be found in every issue. These articles often present unique angles on common problems and concerns in the world of high tech.<br /><br />What makes Wired interesting is the fact that it includes other articles on other subjects- topics that one normally would not associate with a technology magazine. It is common to find articles about popular culture, politics, and other topics and they sometimes seem out of place. One minute you're reading an article about PDA's and the next minute you're reading an article about the war against Iraq. It's a little weird but it also makes for a nice change of pace as you read.<br /><br />Another interesting fact with Wired is that it changes its authors more frequently than other magazines. The magazine has a few regulars but it likes to shuffle the writers around each month. This can be good and it can result in articles that present new and different perspectives each month. But it also means that the magazine is a little uneven and can sometimes include articles that do not communicate the way they should. I can recall reading several articles that left me scratching my head, wondering why the editor didn't make additional changes so that the articles were clearer.<br /><br />The departments in Wired cover a large percentage of the space in every issue and they exceed the total length of many other magazines' department sections. The departments (with the exception of one) occupy the first two- thirds of each issue. The monthly featured articles are found near the end of each issue. This layout is different from other magazines that mix the departments and monthly features together. With Wired, the departments and featured articles are kept separate.<br /><br />Overall, I like Wired as a whole and the political articles rank as my favorite part of each issue. The magazine jumps around from topic to topic and the authors change more frequently than other magazines; two facts that could make Wired a little too scattered for certain readers. Some of the articles are not the best written I have ever seen but Wired is still a good enough magazine to recommend. It keeps readers current on technology, politics, business, and entertainment with a reputation for being modern and hip.",1

Startling graphics alternated with stories prophetizing  the coming of a new world- sort of a ""Matrix"" with on-line grocery delivery and bio-implants.<br />Well, the dot-com bubble burst, Wired shrunk to half or a quarter of its previous size, and what looked like prophesy now reads more like a Popular Mechanics for GenY.

I like to look at what the current styles are, but I prefer magazines that have lots of helpful information on make-up, where to get great buys, etc. I also liked the articles. Short and helpful.

A1G69BQLIUMWPN,1107993600,Changing....,"Seventeen magazine has grown up a lot in the past few year...I am not sure how I feel about that as it tends to mirror the Cosmopolitan magazine quite a bit.  I just wonder how far is too far, because although people don't want to admit it magazines are a part of culture we all looked up to at that time in our lives.  To see the coolest clothes, hair and even questions we were too scared to ask anyone.  I still see that in Seventeen but I also see more sexually oriented material.  I feel some of the stories are stupid.  I still will pick up my sister's Seventeen magazine to see what they have to say and it is amazing how stupid we are trying to make our girls!  A couple of the articles that really fueled me were:  there was a girl who wore short (nasty) skirts to the mall and someone took a picture up her skirt.  When asked what she wears to the mall she answered the SAME THING!  She just wanted attention...that is one reason girls have problems.  Another one was a girl who wore lingerie online and was upset over men-and still has the website!  GET REAL!  What is wrong with the world when these are two of the stories that were main ones in the magazine?!?!  What are girls to learn?  Dress like a skank and get treated like one but continue it?  I don't know about this magazine anymore...I guess it is moving with the times?!  But, my sister still reads it mostly for horoscopes and the music/actors/actresses articles.  My sister said she will not be renewing her subscription  to this magazine after this year as it has turned to trash.",1

A1TFOXCKW4JHIB,1026172800,"Still bleeding edge, which makes it different","The best thing about Wired is that it has stayed true to its roots over all of these years.  Wired has always had a forward-looking, sophisticated attitude toward technology.  You can tell that every article is well-researched and no feature in the magazine is an afterthought.  In every issue, you will find:<br />- stories about the unsung heroes who are really responsible for pushing the limits of technology<br />- some politically-oriented article that shows the growing interplay between technology and politics<br />- cool digital and electronic gadgets (that usually cost a lot of $$)<br />- fun stuff like Jargon watch, Wired vs. Tired, and even some of the ads (how often can you say that?)<br />Beyond that, I find Wired is the best place to read about things like the melding of human and computer and the progess of technology outside of the U.S.  So, I find every issue interesting.  It's a little less useful to me as an investor in technology stocks, but it does offer me that broader perspective on technology that helps put investable ideas into context.  The clincher is the price - a small sacrifice for so much intriguing and entertaining content.  I once considered discontinuing my subscription, but realized that it's so different from everything else I read and just one decent article an issue makes it worthwhile.  Very glad I kept it.  So, if you've never read Wired, I would give it definitely give it a try.",1

The Beauty section names reasonably priced skin and hair products as well as new spa and exercise ideas for health.<br /><br />I find Vogue's ugly and decadent look in editorial and advertising pages repulsive and boring, with only occasional great photos. W wallows in kinky deviance.

AOR590VF8YI5J,1088899200,One of the best teen magazines,"Seventeen has been around for 60 years, and tons of teenagers have grown up with it. Recently, Seventeen got a new look and feel, with more mature articles and interesting features for older teeens. Seventeen is good for those teens who feel like they've outgrown other teen magazines but want one that will guide them through college and beyond.<br />Seventeen features many stuff that teens like to read about- the latest celebrity news, CD and movie release dates, fashion and beauty tips, love and romance, real-life stories, fun stuff to do, and more. As an added bonus, Seventeen covers more worldwide issues then other teen magazines and gives them to you from a teen's point of view. Seventeen also gives you plenty of college and sex advice, which older readers will connect with.<br />What I love about Seventeen is not only the plentiful amounts of news and real-life stories, but also that it features many bargain items in the Fashion section that are awesome and affordable. Seventeen is a wonderful magazine for bargain shopppers- it features plenty of clothes, make-up, hair products, and jewelry for those with smaller budgets. Additionally, the health and fitness pull outs in each issue are wonderful! Seventeen has plenty of nutrition tips and simple workouts that'll have you seeing lots of results fast.<br />Seventeen is a wonderful magazine overall- highly recommended.",1

They do give a nod to up-and-comers by including features like the one with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.<br /><br />I don't mind the many ads since they keep the publishing costs low.<br /><br />A little talk of everything current - art, movies, books and of course the fashion....<br /><br />While it is mostly high end couture that is beyond my budget, it is beautifully photographed and the trends are a treat to admire - I think of this as sort of long distance window shopping.",1

Are you someone who is concerned about health and beauty issues? Are you a person who loves to read about celebrities as well as the latest in music, movies, and TV? Then Seventeen is for YOU!!! In fact, Seventeen has all of these and much more! From recipes to inspiring life stories, from sex to cool celebrity photos, Seventeen is packed with informative and entertaining articles, plus, lots of cool colorful photographs.<br />According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations list of the 100 best selling magazines in the United States, Seventeen is ranked 25th, but none of the ones above Seventeen on the list are directed at teens and young women, thus, making Seventeen the best selling magazine for young readers. It has over 2,000,000 readers to date, and that number is growing. But, not only is Seventeen a best seller, it's also one of the most sought after collectibles in the world! At auctions, I've seen editions from the 70's and 80's sell for as much as [money]each, depending on things such as condition, who was on the cover, etc. And I've noticed that editions of Seventeen do not have to be very old to bring a good price. I've seen editions as little as 2 years old sell for upwards of [money] each. I fell in love with the magazine when I was 17. I was in class when I noticed one of my classmates reading a copy. As I peered over her shoulder, I seen in the magazine one of the most beautiful girls in the world. Turned out, the model would later turn into one of the hottest actresses in film----Phoebe Cates. So I asked my classmate where I could get a copy and she told me I could find them in most any store or get them by subscription. So because of Phoebe Cates, I started collecting the magazine just for her lovely pics. Later, stars such as Brooke Shields,and Jennifer Connelly kept me buying the magazine. Then I began to read the articles and found them both interesting and informative. I can say with assurance that some of the articles in Seventeen have helped keep me looking younger and healthier. So while Seveteen is directed mainly at young women between the ages of 12 and 20, guys can also benefit from some of its contents. It's a magazine that has existed since 1944, and is a favorite among every class of people. If you would like a magazine that is great to read and can be worth something as a collectible in the future, you cannot beat SEVENTEEN!!!",1

It gets worse: Bazaar ""buys of the month"" are a $750 pair of shoes, a $3,235 bag, and a $425 necklace...Yes, $4,000 is indeed my monthly accesories budget...(not!)<br /><br />Over 50% of the magazine pages are advertisements. Bland ones... I buy fashion magazines for the pictures: I may not buy all the clothes, but at least I want to be informed what is current and can figure out how to emulate the looks. However, Bazaar seems to make ""impractical and over the top"" their mantra. Not to mention that UBER expensive is the only way they go...<br /><br />The only reason why I am not angry is the extremely low price I paid for the year's subscription...

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,1300579200,Very good for scratching the surface of science.,"I do enjoy this publication greatly.  It is not quite as technical and in depth as I would like, but how many people would subscribe if it were readable only to physics PhDs?  I do rather enjoy the 'scratching the surface' approach to the articles. I find that there is enough information to give a good overview and decent scientific understanding of the topic yet it is not so complex that I feel as if I am 'working'.<br /><br />There are also some interesting nerdy fun articles such as the worst ideas from the DOD (flying humvees, mutant mosquitos, etc...) to keep a smile of your face.  However, the vast majority of the articles are serious and well written.  There is enough variety of chemistry, astronomy, physics, biology, and environmental science to keep most scientifically minded people interested.  I look forward to each and every issue.",1

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292284800,Little Nuggets of Information I Find Useful,"Bottom-line: Popular Science is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.<br /><br />I have always delved into the minutia of how things work.  This natural curiosity grew from, where I don't know where it comes from exactly.  Perhaps it part of the male brain, or perhaps just part of mine; I like to take things apart and see how they work.  It's not enough to know that if I pay my electric bill on time, when I flick on a light switch I will have light; I want to know how the electricity is generated and how it got to the switch.  That same curiosity led me to my current profession as an Information Technology professional.  What started out as a hobby, a need to know how computers worked, has turned into a second career for me.<br /><br />All of this explains why I subscribe to and read Popular Science Magazine [...], whose slogan is The Future Is Now.  As magazines go, Popular Science is a pretty thin rag, but that does not mean the monthly is not packed with all manner of useful and informative information.  it does mean that the magazine is not (over) burdened with page after page of annoying advertising.  There is of course advertising, a magazine could not survive without it, but is it not overly intrusive and overbearing.<br /><br />Regular sections in the magazine include:<br /><br />o Features: feature length articles;<br />o Megapixels<br />o What's New<br />o Headlines<br />o How 2.0<br />o FYI<br />o Other Stuff: includes Letters, and editor's note.<br /><br />My favorite section is What's New; I tend to read it first every month.  Each section is filled with six or seven pages of text and illustrations one the latest and greatest new products and prototypes from across the world in the science, general technology and astronomy fields. The latest issue featured a big bold article on the future of police equipment, called Cop Tech; Inside The Police R&R Lab. A flashy title to be sure, but is backed up with quality writing as well as pictures and or images of the equipment and gadgets discussed in the article.<br /><br />Other articles in this month's (February 2007) magazine include:<br /><br />o Protect Everything; the future of personal security.<br />o Journey From The Center of The Earth; Popsci Innovator<br />o It Came From The Lab; Uncommon Knowledge<br />o Fly The Friendly Seas; Concepts & Prototypes<br /><br />The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  Aside from the feature articles, the most informative portion of the magazine are the one or two page explanation features wherein some present or future gadget is explained, usually accompanied by an illustration.  For example on page 27 of this month's issue under the Headlines section the magazine explains in great detail--complete with illustration--how the Department of Energy is building a greener coal plant, that will extract Hydrogen--called Syngas--from water and use it to produce electricity.  The coal is used in the process and the Carbon it creates as a by-product is pumped underground into a saline solution.  The item was short, but came away from it with a thorough understanding of a process I had heretofore never heard of.<br /><br />I have only one minor quibble with the magazine: almost one third of the back half of the monthly is given over to adverting.  Not the expensive glossy, glamorous kind, but the shady little, not so sure you can thrust what their advertising kind found is too many other wise respectable magazines.<br /><br />Subscriptions<br /><br />Popular Science Magazine is published by Time 4 Media. In addition to the English language edition, Popular Science is also published in China, Israel, Korea and Mexico. Book shelf sells for a cover price of $3.99 US, Canada $4.99, while a 12-month subscription will set you back $15.95 and a 24-month subscription checks in at 21.95. If you are doing the math--and you should--that's a 77% saving off the single copy price. You might be able to find a better deal at one of the on-line magazine subscription sites like Magazines.com, or e-Subscription.com.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Other than that one decidedly minor quibble, I have no qualms recommending Popular Science to anyone who asks.  The magazine is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.",1
A281NPSIMI1C2R,1135728000,Blueberry Pudding & Food Festivals,"Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials.<br /><br />While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills.<br /><br />After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard.<br /><br />Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

A1L43KWWR05PCS,1126224000,I LOVE THIS MAGAZINE!...,"This is simply a beautiful magazine, printed on heavy, glossy paper. Its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods, wines, and the countries from which they originate. It is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow, it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries, their food and wine, their  restaurants, and their culture. Usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about. The articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information.<br /><br />I am a tea lover, and I love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones, dainty sandwiches, and light cakes. So, I particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea. It transported the reader to Devon, England with its afternoon tradition of  tea and scones, accompanied by clotted cream and  jam, which is often referred to as a cream tea. Of course, a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea. This, too, is discussed in the article. Photographs of an authentic village tearoom in Devon were included, as well as recipes for making scones, tea sandwiches, black currant jam, strawberry jam, and Victoria Sponge Cake.<br /><br />The article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made. It interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream. A guide was included for Devon in terms of where to stay, where to eat, and where to go for tea. The article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences, detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea, a cream tea, and a high tea, and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each.  I so enjoyed this article! Even if I never physically go to Devon, I feel as if the magazine had transported me there, as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand. The magazine has these types of articles in every issue, covering regions from all over the world, including those in the United States.<br /><br />The magazine also contains a helpful section titled, ""The Pantry"", which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine. This makes it invariably easier for the reader, who may wish try some of the more esoteric recipes, to find what one needs. It is little wonder that I love this magazine. Those who are interested in wonderful food, excellent and easy to follow recipes, other cultures and customs, as well as traveling, will simple adore this magazine. It makes a wonderful gift. I know, because this magazine was a gift to me and one for which I am grateful, as it is a gift that one gets to enjoy again and again, each and every month.",1
A2JJGIJI8X6KRS,1026777600,Not your typical Cooking Magazine,"I have over 16 Magazine subscriptions, 10 of them being Cooking Magazines. Saveur provides you with a different sort of cooking magazine, definately with a heavy intent on the background of food, their articles are more in depth about the locations and even the layout of the magazine is different.<br />If you enjoy this magazine there is a web-site that you absolutely must check out it's called ""ethnic grocer"" you can find all of the rare ingredients that you find in some of the recipes that are featured in Saveur. I always feel like I've actually walked in the shoes of the writer and the articles are so vivid that you can almost taste the exotic-ness <---- is that word?) LOL of the flavors.

A3KT1J40AI9GYJ,1381190400,One of the few magazines I read cover to cover,"I read a lot of magazines. My roommates sigh everytime they check the mail because they inevitably have to carry home heavy piles of glossy paper encased in plastic wrap. Marie Claire is probably my favorite magazine out of all the ones I read (I read most fashion and women's health magazines) because it provides a bit of everything that the average young professional woman like myself enjoys. Some of its interest pieces about real life people are thought-provoking and well-written. There is almost always a feature article about some celebrity, but Marie Claire takes the time to interview the celebrity and try to get a different perspective on her life. Finally, MC also has all the other fun and frills that any girl wants when she mindlessly reads a magazine while getting a mani/pedi - beauty tips, fashion ideas etc.",1
A3GA09FYFKL4EY,1379030400,Must-have for fans of fashion!,"Marie Claire is a wonderful read, and well worth the money for the beauty tips alone! I have many issues that I keep just for reference.  Marie Claire has it all:  the best fashions on the runway, recommendations for all income levels and body types.  I love Vogue, but more for entertainment value, since I can't afford the clothes advertised in it.  Marie Claire has something for every woman in every background and income level to enjoy.<br /><br />Interviews, articles and reader input are also excellent.  This isn't just a ""mirror, mirror"" magazine.  Articles explore social issues and current affairs along with the usual celebrity features.  I bought a two-year subscription, and am already making plans to renew.<br /><br />Highly recommend!",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1260489600,"Improve Your Knowledge, with Popular Science","Popular Science is a magazine I have been reading on and off for more than twenty years and it ranks as a science magazine for the masses. As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.<br /><br />Popular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.<br /><br />The writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.<br /><br />Learning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top.",1

Antiques, quirky pieces found at flea markets, crafts and trendy bits grace the homes, with advice on how to get the same look for yourself.<br /><br />If you love Southern Living or Better Homes & Gardens, but can't afford the shocker price tags of their decorating styles, you'll really like Country Living.  It offers something for every style and income level - and goes beyond the ""rooster cookie jar and gingham curtains"" that most people visualize when they think of ""country decor.""

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1175212800,"GQ: Different From the Past, but Still Okay","GQ magazine has been around for a long time and, like other men's magazines, it has changed over the years. In an effort to attract more readers, GQ has spiced up some of its articles with more sex and it is common to find a scantily clad female on the cover- a place that used to be reserved exclusively for men. This isn't to say that the articles have suffered greatly from the changeover. There are still several good articles in each issue of GQ, combined with a few too many articles about relationships.<br /><br />When GQ is at its best is when the magazine is talking politics, entertainment, and/or culture. I have read many interesting political articles in GQ, ranging from topics like homeland security to men's rights when it comes to abortion. The entertainment articles are also quite good and the GQ team can be counted on to deliver some good, frank discussion about movies, books, movies, Hollywood celebrities, etc.<br /><br />GQ used to seem a little more fashion oriented than it is today. There are still several fashion related articles in each issue but the difference is that the GQ of today contains articles in a wider range of topics than in the past. This is fine by me, because the fashion articles rank low on my list of reading priorities. I would much rather read, say, an article that debates the efforts to ban smoking than an article about buying the right shoes to wear in a business casual workplace.<br /><br />Many magazines skimp when it comes to reading material but not GQ. You get your money's worth with this magazine. Each issue is the length of a book, with anywhere from 250 to 350 or more pages per issue and from 25 to 30 different featured articles, departments, and monthly columns to read (combined). This makes for a lot of reading. Even of you take the advertisement space into account, there is still plenty to read in each issue. It also means that, whatever your fancy, you should find something interesting to read every month.<br /><br />Overall, GQ is a good magazine for men and it contains some decent entertainment news, political analysis, and fashion tips. It is aimed at men in their early thirties and while I don't like it as much as similar publications I still think GQ is a decent magazine. Its long length makes it easily worth the low cost and with so much reading material, there is something for everyone in each issue. What others have said is true: It isn't the magazine it once was. But there is still enough of the good stuff to recommend this publication.",1
AEMZRE6QYVQBS,1172880000,legendary means 'takes potshots without flinching',"GQ is a publication that merits the adjective 'legendary'. As a frontrunner in its genre, it takes potshots from many angles but - one thinks of Mercedes-Benz or Oxford University - keeps on doing well what it does well. (This reviewer drives a Ford and attended Cambridge, so I'm trying to be generous here ...)<br /><br />GQ is actually several magazines bound into one.<br /><br />First, it is a high-end fashion catalogue. Unless you work your way through a *lot* of advertising pages to the material that follows, you may think you've picked up a catalogue rather than a 'quarterly'.<br /><br />Second, GQ consistently presents excellent short and medium-length fiction and non-fiction writing. If the juxtaposition of preening male style with superb writing surprises you, well, welcome to the club. They're both undeniably here  between the same covers.<br /><br />Finally, GQ offers great tips on style in a whimsical, always interesting way. Simply put, you can get edumacated on style by working through this third magazine bound into the GQ format.<br /><br />As an avid reader and founder of an executive coaching company that includes guidance on how to look the part without spending the kind of money that shows up in 'Magazine A"", I read Magazines B and C with gusto.<br /><br />GQ is not everything. You may want to evade the whiff of pretension that comes from being seen with GQ tucked under your arm.  But if Magazine A, B, or C is what you're seeking, you may want to subscribe to this venerable legend.",1

A5RHZE7B8SV5Q,1078531200,One of the most renowned magazines.,"They really seem to have turned around with their new editor in chief, who came on board in the September issue. They have some cool stories, even if some of them do get continued in the back, but that just means (depending on how far along you are), that you have the rest of the mag to look forward to. I don't really like any of the style tips and the clothes, and depending on how big the issue is, you'll have to trudge through about 30 pages of ads, before u get to the first page of the TOC. It's nice to see an Editor's column (or page) now, even though this EIC seems to be just a little too arrogant. Like every mature men's mag, they review CD's and books. I'd say 8 out of 12 issues are usually thick, and I'm not sure if the September issue (their last monstrously huge issue) will be like that this year or not, Overall, it's still very interesting.

A309PFW8T6DMMZ,1351036800,"A fun magazine, but going downhill","This is relatively light reading. Don't expect detailed plans for how to implement any of the ideas shown. However, I usually get at least a couple good ideas of out each issue. I prefer this magazine to Martha Stewart Living, which is more food-focused. Don't get me wrong - there are still plenty of food recipes in each issue of Country Living. However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining.<br /><br />UPDATE: I used to look forward to receiving my issues in the mail. However, the magazine seems to be going in a new direction. One part of that is focusing more on older items, such as expensive vintage items I could never afford to buy. Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest.

This is already the second place in the issue in just the first few pages that highlights women artisans and made in the USA hand crafted goods. This magazine tries to keep things accessible to its readers, quoting sources we can use not just designer industry insiders.<br /><br />Yes, there are a ton of ads (like pretty much any other magazine) but if the ads help keep my subscription cost to a measly $5 per year then the ads are fine with me!<br /><br />Pleased with this purchase and definitely recommended.",1

The magazine is just a hollow whole for many of us now.  I saw that other felt empty after reading it also and I don't blame them.  A lot of the workouts are not for people who don't live in a city or live in a gym.  And I do not live in either.

A1TFOXCKW4JHIB,1027123200,My favorite of the three major business mags,"I am a voracious reader of business periodicals.  I subscribe to and read four business magazines and three financial newspapers on a regular basis.  Between Forbes, Fortune and BusinessWeek, I always look most forward to receiving my next issue of Forbes.  Why?  Several reasons:<br />- The articles are generally shorter and more ""to the point"" than Fortune.  Forbes is also not as beholden as BusinessWeek is to cover the hot news stories.<br />- This magazine is the best of the three for discovering new investment ideas and it is generally more investor focused than either Fortune or BW.<br />- The editorials throughout the magazine are usually thought-provoking and I guarantee you will develop your own favorite columnists whom you will look forward to reading in each issue<br />- Forbes has a politically conservative and pro-business slant (with Steve Forbes as Editor-in-Chief, that should be no surprise).<br />- Forbes offers two supplemental issues, which are quarterly.  Forbes ASAP is entirely focused on technology and many articles are actually thought pieces written by influential executives, investors, and technology visionaries.  Forbes FYI features lighter articles which are thematically aimed at the upper class.  You will probably find some of the stories (and the ads) irrelevant to your life (we're not all millionaires yet, are we?).  But it's an amusing magazine and it's a good break for me from the stream of more business-oriented stuff I read.<br />I do enjoy all three of the major business magazines I mentioned.  But if you made me drop two of them, I'd keep Forbes. The reasonable price is just icing on the cake and gives you no excuse not to try it out.  I bet you'll be hooked.",1

A1RPTVW5VEOSI,1056931200,Variable,"The New Yorker was started by Harold Ross as a humor magazine, and grew into one of the world's most celebrated literary magazines. It never really made money or had a huge circulation, but survived thanks to the generosity of a number of private owners and publishers. I began reading the New Yorker thanks to my mother, who subscribed for nearly four decades. Through it I discovered Berton Rouche's fascinating ""Medical Detective"" stories, Calvin Trillin's hilarious stories about food and travel, the brilliant writing of John McPhee, and scores of other contemporary reporters and short story writers.<br />Then, in the 1980s, Trisha Brown then managed to completely trash the magazine in only a few short years. Circulation took off- for a time, at least- but the reputation of the New Yorker was sacrificed as it was turned into a gossip magazine. The low point, for me, at least, was a fawning article on poor Erich Honnekar's trial in Germany where he was being charged for ordering the shootings of those East Germans who tried to flee to the west. (Brown's husband, it turned out, had been retained by Honnekar's defense team to do PR work).<br />Old time subscribers defected by the thousands, and the new subscribers, being a fickle lot, let their subscriptions lapse as well once The New Yorker was no longer a hip fashion accessory to be seen on your coffeetable alongside the latest issue of Interview.<br />In recent years the magazine has regained some- but not all- or its former glory. The political analysis is still of the fawning variety (neither the Clintons nor the Kennedys can do any wrong) and the fiction has become even more parochial, but a lot of the good reporting has returned.

A1KXONFPU2XQ5K,1046995200,Fascinating Articles,"I have taken this magazine for about 2 years now, and personally, I enjoy it quite a bit. I am not a native of the New York area, nor have I any affiliations with the fine city. Personally I find the articles to be so well written in the New Yorker it is hard to put down. For me this means the first section of the paper is under appreciated, as its all about New York City, gossip and much more. The articles are of a wide varity of topics and often bring up points that may have had rolling around in your conscious but have never let them bubble up to the top. Fascinating articles can range from politics, famous lives of famous peoples, religious societies, and so much more.<br />This magazine is great if you are a reader. Articles are wordy, and worthwhile. This isn't something your going to be reading just the highlights through. I hardly find myself able to finish a magazine before the next one comes. If you are open minded, and love to read quality articles that will make you think, this magazine for you.",1

Im also holding a special edition of Forbes that has the listing of the Forbes 400 (listed to be the identitive randking of the richest people in America) that was listed for display until January 5, 2015. Jerry yang is on the front of the cover and there is a feature listed to be a scorecard consisting of men and women who are self-made and those who are silver spoon.  An article on Business Aviation (pages  117-122), pages  130-132 feature the rankings of the 15th to the 19th richest people in America, and pages 168-174 feature the  167th to 190th richest. Forbes also has other special edition magazines such as the 2015 Investment Guide Special Issue of the Road Map To Riches titled Your Best 32 Investment Investment Ideas and listed to Display Until March 16, 2015. The Leader Board (page 32) and 25 Years of Guaranteed Income (starts on page 108) are some of the article features with the Forbes Special issue 2015 Investment Guide. As mentioned in a previous review, I would be fine with being employed until Im at least 85. The only reason why my husband and I are already planning to save enough money to comfortably retire by the late 2030s/early2040s is because of our shared belief that social security in the U.S. will not pay enough for even a cheap apartment  by the time the late 2040s/early 2050s roll around. Additionally, we are both aware that were part of a generation where retirement accounts are our responsibility, self-employment may be necessary and not just a take it or leave it option, and also preparing for the possibility of age related discrimination still existing for both the male and female genders of all races/ethnicities (especially with me being a minority woman).",1

Forbes delivers a variety of unique perspectives not found elsewhere and is kind of like a monthly WSJ in editorials and opinion. Of the top four I referenced, Fortune vs Forbes is perhaps the most commonly considered in competition. The winner is a no-brainer - I'll reach for Forbes over Fortune every time.<br /><br />Amazon has come far in its mag offerings from a pricing standpoint.

AVF9FV7AMRP5C,1256947200,"Forbes delivers high quality articles, but its liberal bashing gets tiring","Forbes is a conservative business publication that delivers excellent reporting and feature articles. The content is concise, blunt, and to the point because Forbes recognizes the importance of time and clarity. The magazine is especially strong in providing advice to individuals, and businesses about upcoming changes in the tax code, and legislation that would impact the bottom line. However, I have found that the editorial content has become a venue for editors to make personal attacks towards Obama and the democratic party.<br /><br />Pros:<br />As a business magazine, Forbes does an excellent job at delivering succinct articles about business, economics, and stocks. In each issue, the magazine devotes a large section towards dispensing advice about money and investing. There is a depth and detail that can only be found in this magazine. Forbes assumes its readers are astute and smart, and is unwilling to dumb down its content to boost circulation numbers. In a recent article, Forbes provided detailed advice about retirement accounts, and their tax implications.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Forbes can improve its publication by editorializing less and focus more on business issues, and less bashing upon liberal politics. For example, Forbes can take the lead and recommend to businesses ways to reduce health care costs by writing about Safeway, which has been able to tame healthcare inflation. If the magazine authors wants to express their political beliefs, then they are working for the wrong magazine.",1

It seems that there has been an across-the-board change toward the 30-second sound bites. You only see some of that in Forbes, but it's annoying. If I want that, I can go online to any of the major news networks.<br /><br />Forbes still has the best financial and business analysis for the U.S. The Economist might edge it out on international issues, but that's not an apples-to-apples comparison. It beats Business Week and the other domestic rags.<br /><br />The only complaint is the number of multi-page ads in the middle of the story and it being hard to see where the ad ends and the story continues. That may be by design, but it's annoying.<br /><br />Another good thing about Forbes is that it's written well. It's like the Atlantic for the business world.

The bulk of the magazine, however, is an extended advertisement for high-tech outdoors gear, punctuated by ads for SUVs the size of earthmoving equipment that every true outdoorsman or woman needs.<br />Outdoors is rather like the numerous amateur photography magazines that obsess about equipment and yet have very little to say about the aestheic of art.

Other articles seem completely general interest that would not be of any more interest to an outdoorsy person than anyone else.  There are entertaining travel articles about writers' trips without too much practical information if you were to plan a trip.  However, in the back there is a large section of advertisements from all kinds of outdoor adventure places.  The photography section is lovely; there are a couple of pages of just artistic photos.

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,1416614400,Outside The Box Information,"I understand that a different months magazine issue may already be available by the time I post this review. However, I admit that I spotted this November 2014 magazine issue of Outside at my job and obviously decided to take a chance on it.  There are interesting articles in this issue such as: page sixty to seventy one titled under Work< Play, Live: This Way Forward An Eight Step Plan For Rebooting Your Career and Finding A Job You Love by Abe Streep. Illustrations are by Peter Arkle and the following are some of the men and women featured: Adam Fetcher 37, Director of Global PR And Communications Patagonia. Fetcher worked on multiple press jobs  in the Department of Homeland Security, he then worked on President Obamas re-election campaign in 2012, and launched a communications firm in Minnesota before being contacted by Patagonia in 2013. Tom Stewart, Michael Charley, and Megan Miller are some of the multiple people featured within the inspirational article. What I enjoyed the most about the story being written is that some of the men and women featured are in their late 30s/early 40s which sends a positive message that a person can experience a career breakthrough later in life regardless of their professional aims and/or what their skeptics think.",1

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,1296086400,Seriously... change the name to 'GQ Rugged Version',"I subscribe to many outdoor themed magazines and have to say that I have never seen a magazine take such a dive in quality as quickly and drastically as this.  Gone are the great tales of survival and adventure (except in one issue per year).  Instead the magazine is filled with dozens of glossy photos of males modeling overpriced clothing.  Add to this the sheer volume of advertisements and you have very little left for stories or expeditions.  Most of the travel notes are for places that cost terribly much money and would be better represented in Conde Naste or National Geographic Traveler.<br /><br />For true outdoor enthusiasts I recommend Runners World (it is geared towards running but does feature some great product reviews), Trail Running, and National Geographic Adventure.  Outside magazine is obviously a marketing outlet and I am sure they make big income from the obviously biased product reviews and destination write ups.  I understand this is how the world works... but I will find other sources for my outdoor fix... such as actually going outdoors.  This is not the magazine for true outdoor enthusiasts, but for those who want to dream about buying the gear and never actually using it.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />So I'm not on an auto renewal plan or anything, but I have been getting this magazine for about 3 years now... and it's followed me to my new apartment without me submitting a new address! (Seriously, they are printing my new address - not the post office stickers!).

A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,1088640000,The Best Mass Market Personal Finance Magazine,"I have subscribed to ""Kiplinger's"" for a number of years now, and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. The magazine is inexpensive, timely, and authoritative, and conveys complex financial concepts in easily comprehensible terms. The magazine is very in favor of long term, high quality stock market investing, and on a monthly basis covers something relevant to current investment issues in the stock market. It also covers important information on taxes, retirement, paying for tuition, mortgages, and making good car buying (or leasing) decisions.<br />The magazine is a great source of news as it is related to your financial life in ways that are sometimes obvious, and sometimes less so. For instance they have articles on annuities, which you would expect, but also on drug costs, which you might not. They also have extremely useful mutual fund performance charts in every issue, which I find to be among the best features in the magazine. With the passage of different tax laws, ""Kiplinger's"" writes on the practical implications of the Federal tax code changes as well as regularly looking at state tax issues.<br />There are many personal financial magazines covering many different areas available today.

The best part of Kiplinger's is that it describes how real people with average salaries, kids, and debts can invest for the future.  There are also some great articles for parents about how to teach their kids to manage their money.  Everything seems practical, but I've yet to try any of it.  The magazine is broken into four sections: `Ahead' short articles about finance news and current event, `investing' about investing mostly stocks, `your money' about ways to invest your money though not as technical as the investing section and more diverse, and `spending' which is basically general interest about new fun technologies and other ways to spend all the money saved or made through investing.",1

Each magazine presents the news of science in its own special way.<br /><br />In the current issue I am reading (all magazines change their format over time), the first section is called ""Data"" and it covers the latest science news on a variety of topics. This is followed by section consisting of a series of articles each no more that several pages long. A favorite of mine is called ""Vital Signs"" which usually covers some intriguing, difficult to solve, true life medical mystery. This month's issue was about a 16-month old boy with a lemon-sized mass in his chest. A theme of this current issue is called ""The Cure"" involving a series of articles on possible cures on the horizon for AIDS, various vaccines for illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and allergies, and a very interesting article on Bio Hackers also known as do-it-yourself biology (DIYbio).

A1RPTVW5VEOSI,1058227200,Science without the Science,"Discover is a very successful magazine, and it acheived that success  with a formula that owes as much to the example of ""People"" magazine as it does to anything. It manages with cover all sorts of cutting edge stories without ever actually getting into the actual science involved. Instead, it concentrates on the people involved, the politics, the history... anything but the science.<br />Here's an example: A recent issue had an interesting piece on the physics of rocks skipping... expect it wasn't on the physics of rock skipping so much as it was on a particular fellow was was the world's champion rock skipper. Yes, there *was* a formula in a side bar that purported to describe the physics of a skipping rock, and some of the terms were even defined... but there was no explanation of the formula, or even any numbers. It was simple ""Here's a formula. It's very impressive looking, isn't it? Now on to other things."" And there was some history of how people looked at rock skipping, and even some allusions to how the physics of rock skipping had applications in understanding the physics of other phenomena. But what you couldn't find in the entire article was a single sentance that actually discussed the physics involved!<br />So what Discovery really is, is a magazine about science and scientists that doesn't actually have any science in it. And while there's a place for that sort of thing, if you're looking for actual discussions of science and technology that are still presented in a way that the educated non-scientist can understand, you'd be far better off with New Scientist or Science Week.

They have other publications and a great (not free) website.  They don't accept advertising or allow companies to use their reviews to market their products.  It's a great magazine to read for fun, and I wouldn't think of buying anything significant without consulting it, as it educates about features and other issues about products.  They're particularly good on new and used cars, and take one through the whole purchasing process.  One aspect I really enjoy is the amazing charts and tables.  And the inside back cover has hysterically funny and ironic 'mistakes' made in companies' advertisements.  One isn't always going to agree with their reviews -- individuals may value aspects of a product that they consider trivial -- but not reading their reviews to learn about what's out there would be a big mistake.",1
A26KYDJOAGI05S,1039996800,Not Mindless Enough,"When I was an undergraduate, I used to get this magazine every month, and I loved it.  I loved the broad range of topics from archeology to cybernetics and everything in-between.  Then the other day, I picked up a copy of Discover, and I just wanted to put it down.  I'm a grad student, and I read technical journals all the time, so when I pick something up for pleasure reading I want it to be mindless, and Discover is not.  Many of the topics that I know about were explain in more detail than I would have expected for a lay publication. The articles are well written and each is fully explained so that anyone not in the field who reads them carefully could understand them.  I think Discover is great for anyone who is not a scientist but has a broad interest in scientific advances or for undergraduates who aren't sure which field to pursue.",1
A1RPTVW5VEOSI,1058227200,Somewhat Useful,"A friend of mine once remarked that CR seesm like a great magazine ""until they write about something you actually know a bit about..."" and that's the problem with CR. They're great when it comes to quantifiable things like repair frequency, reliability, warranty information and so forth. They're much less useful when it comes to reporting on subjective things, or on technical matters.<br />That's a problem with trying to review every possible consumer item;  you can't be an expert on everything. Sure, CR has their own labs and testers, but they're as likely as not, when confronted with something they can't quantify, to come up with some arbitrary measure and then rate products on that. For example, I've read some hilarious HiFi reviews that never involved actually *listening* to units. Instead, they take some statistic they consider to be critical and rate all units on that. Computer reviews often are very superficial- you'd do far, far better with PC or a similar magazine. And some of their financial advice on life insurance, mortgages and investment has been rather narrow, preaching single solutions for all.<br />So yeah, read CR when you're buying that next vacuum cleaner, or toaster, or popcorn popper, but before making any major purchasers or investments I'd look a bit further than the pages of CR.",1
A1TFOXCKW4JHIB,1009324800,Bottom line:  worth the money,"I've been a subscriber for about five years now.  A couple of times, I've considered not renewing.  Then I'll get an issue that seems to make the entire year's subscription worth it.  Stuff like washing machines, new cars, computer monitors, even sunscreen.  At a minimum, these truly independent reviews (the organization is non-profit and the magazine is ad-free) focus you on the pivotal issues regarding each product and provide questions to ask in making your purchase.  At its best, it pretty much does your screening for you and all that's left for you to do is choose between 2 or 3 brands.  I also have to admit I get a good chuckle out of the last page, where consumers have submitted ads or product descriptions that are either misleading or just erroneous.  Every issue is not necessarily useful.  I think it's ridiculous for them to review things like cereal or restaurants, which I feel are personal preferences, or detergents, which are pretty similar nowadays.  But think about this magazine subscription as insurance against a bad purchase or as an investment that can pay you back several times over by saving you hundreds of dollars.  Bottom line:  it's worth the money.",1

A2AV7Q95QGPTO0,1184371200,Mediocre,"Perhaps the most useful way to classify magazines offering investment advice is by the markets they serve.

AEMZRE6QYVQBS,1155340800,a common touch and a devoted fan base,"Kiplinger's Personal Finance is a worthy challenge to Money Magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends, helpful financial tips, and - in KPF's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor.<br /><br />I came to KPF by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of Kiplinger Letters (for which, see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago.  She probably thought that without I'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness, where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion.<br /><br />I eventually migrated up the Kiplinger food chain to the glossier KPF and have never left.<br /><br />Much of the information provided by KPF (mutual fund and ETF results and the like) are widely available. The same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees, diversify, don't bail under pressure).<br /><br />Where KPF excels is in the short articles and tips, which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. Two fine recent examples: the articles in the September 2006 issue entitled 'Buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'.  Both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions I'm likely to make in the new year. What's more, the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate.<br /><br />In terms of macro-economic instincts, the Kiplinger Washington Editors run bullish, though not quite so much as Money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. KPF won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either, a fact that is well observed by their authors, who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or German auto makers.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about KPF if it were my only source. But KPF's monthly arrival is still always welcomed, as it has been for years. It remains firmly entrenched in my top tier.",1

A1PGC1GEBY9CZU,1455321600,"From Roof to Subfloor, No Controversy Here","This is a review of the magazine and not the subscription through Amazon.<br /><br />Good Housekeeping, like many magazines if its ilk, makes its money on advertising.  Given that fact, many pages are nothing but either ads or infomercials.  Once past that, there really IS a good magazine hidden between those pages.<br /><br />I have been an on again and off again subscriber since the early 80s when I returned to the U.S. after a five year stint in the military living in Europe.  You might find it odd but this magazine helped with my transition to the land of consumerism and commercialism.<br /><br />Good Housekeeping keeps up with trends and ideas for the modern home.  From solar water systems to water heated floors, from pink rose pedals to rose hip tea, GH has been there.  Given the duration this magazine has been in operation, earning a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval is sometimea a boon to business and that push needed for national recognition.<br /><br />GH is NOT a controversial magazine.  The editors would probably have coronaries just at the thought of causing controversy.  This is an enjoyable read, cover to cover, once the advertising is overlooked.  But sometimes, that advertising is just what is needed.",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1282867200,Popular Mechanics: Practical and often Fascinating,"Popular Mechanics is a magazine dedicated to mechanics, repair, industry, and technology. This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.<br /><br />These achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.<br /><br />Besides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.<br /><br />Popular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable.",1

A1KN6H7YG6WTIB,1282780800,A little Too Old Tradition,"I enjoy this magazine but feel it is more so for an older female crowd. Despite the awesome prices, it still rings to me as a housewife type of magazine which is fine if you enjoy working in the home. It has useful tips but I was overwhelmed by all the ads. The content is a little weak for me and does not expand beyond the kitchen and the dish washing and the cooking really- in my opinion. I wish the content was more gender equal- the magazine is for sure geared toward the older married perhaps with children woman. Or single lady working in the home. I will not be subscribing to this magazine again due to personal taste. I bought it because it was so cheap but all my issues have only been laying around unread after reading the first two I received. The content needs to be more rich. The ads less.",1

A3NWN21HH5CEWZ,1218326400,Solid 3.5 stars,This is pretty good magazine and for the price of a $8 it is a steal.  I give the magazine itself 3.5 stars and the price with it 4 stars.  There are many good ideas in this magazine and one of the only magazines besides my favorite (All You) that offers normal clothes and normal stores.  The past months articles on saving money were well thought out and were easy things to try.  The idea of putting a filled bottle water in the back of your toilet to decrease how much water needed per flush was a great idea!  The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the constant need to have celebrities on the front cover while the articles about them aren't direct interviews - just some statements made to other people here and there.  Seems lame.  Otherwise this is one of the better mom magazines out there.,1

OK, as for the magazine itself, this is another one my mom likes to read and which I find myself checking out from time to time. Good Housekeeping has existed for many years and is ranked 5th in the USA for sales! It has a circulation of over 4,000,000. It covers an array of topics including: food, fitness, beauty, child care, money management, health news, travel, and human interest stories. This is a magazine that would be great for any homemaker (is that one word or two?) If you are a parent or someone who has their own place, this magazine could be a big benefit to you.

And five minutes later, you are still looking for ""that"" article. Well, in this magazine they have a great Contents page with a special: ""On the Cover"" section. So, if you want to read about Nicole Kidman she is on page 110! OK, that was in the November 2001 issue and it is quite a sad article. What ever happened to the fairy tale? I just don't know...<br /><br />Now, if you love reading about other people who are making the news, the People section always has something fun to read about. Fashion and beauty gives ideas on the latest nail color or makeup tips. The articles on relationships are interesting.<br /><br />This magazine also has sections for: Health & Well Being, Consumer Sense, The Better Way, Food & Home, Fiction, Departments and Columns. The TECH section is always of interest. There is a definite focus on women, as in: ""The Best Cell Phones for Women."" Plus, this is where you can find Heloise giving out the newest Household Tips.<br /><br />My favorite page is the looks, trends, and news page where they always give you ideas for holidays or feature beauty products like Pumpkin Pie body wash in November.

Do the new stick-on manicures work? What is the newest information on cancer prevention?<br /><br />Dr. Andrew Weil has a 5-minute section with holistic-health advice where he explains why Wild Alaskan salmon and blueberries will keep skin youthful. Is the air in your home as clean as it could be?<br /><br />Fun product pages offer seasonal comforts. For summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans. Special sections show you how to lose weight, even when on vacation. Interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin.<br /><br />The only thing in the magazine of concern seems to be the advice section which I read, but take some of her advice with a big pinch of salt. If someone thinks they are suffering from an addiction, they probably are. I'm at times rather surprised by her answers that seem to lean towards a casual approach to serious life-changing situations, although she seems to give women great advice about health issues when it comes to making them feel better about breast cancer or work situations.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1097971200,Here's to Your Good Health,"Health Magazine is a publication that gears its articles toward a wide array of health- related issues and concerns. When I came across a copy for the first time, I picked it up to read with a degree of skepticism. I thought it would be a magazine exclusively about nutrition, but that turned out not to be the case. This magazine does spend some time talking about healthy eating habits, but this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this magazine. The editors of this publication talk about all sorts of health topics, like mental health, relationships, parenting, physical fitness, etc. Because of this, Health has something that will appeal to almost anyone who reads it.<br /><br />This magazine is divided into five main areas: Beauty, Body, Fitness, Mind, and Food. My personal favorites are the Mind and Food sections. I like the Mind area the best because it's the one where I usually find articles that are most relevant to my own health concerns. Here, you can learn about useful things like how to reduce stress in your work and in life, how to deal with problem children, and other informative topics. To a lesser extent, I also like the Food section because it includes some very interesting recipes that show how you can spice up ordinary, routine meals for little cost and minimal effort.<br /><br />If there is one thing to criticize about this publication, it would have to be the fact that it is primarily geared toward women. The Beauty section, for example, is focused almost entirely on feminine concerns, with advice on makeup, eliminating wrinkles, etc. Some of these articles could, of course, be applied toward men but they are mostly centered on woman and the models used in the photos throughout most of the sections of the magazine are female. On the flip side, however, my criticism will prove to be an asset for women, many of whom will find this magazine very useful.<br /><br />Still, in spite of this small criticism, Health is still a very good magazine for all to read. Remember- this is not just a nutrition magazine. The importance of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs comprises only a small part of the publication. The remaining sections of the magazine feature some very useful articles on mental health, relationships, disease control and prevention, healthy cooking, etc., making Health a good publication with articles and columns that anyone can relate to.",1
A1KXONFPU2XQ5K,1048896000,Worth a read,"In general many health magazines seem to focus on glamour and make you wonder what's wrong with you since you can't be a size 2, work out for 3 hours a day, balance a job, family and whatever else life throws your way.  The magazine comes with several articles a month that focus on looking good, exercise plans, diet tips, stress relief, and a few that promote good mental health.  I like this because its low key and sensible.  This magazine isn't set out to change your life, but enhance what you have and show you a few new ideas.",1
A26KYDJOAGI05S,1039737600,About the business (not the skill) of writing,"The main target audience of Writer's Digest appears to be freelance writers.  Most of the authors are freelance magazine article writers who have finally `made it', and that is what they write about.  There are a few short articles about writing (usually written by the same people each month), but that is not the main focus of the magazine. A large portion of the articles are about technical topics related to publishing, and not writing.  This magazine is not for people who want to learn about writing; it's more for people who want to learn about how to sell their writing. The advertisements in the back of the magazine are so shady that Writer's Digest actually has to put a disclaimer on each page (think results are not typical in the lose 100 pounds in ten minutes infomercial), and I now get `if you can write a letter like this one, you could make a million dollars a year' junk mail as well.  The best part is the writing calendar with writing prompts for each day.  This is a great resource for writing exercises and generating story ideas.  However, it can be accessed for free from their website.",0
A1U0RB0NEJ5PLO,1450224000,Great magazine for writers,I look forward to this magazine every time. Always insightful articles that are written by knowledgeable people.,1

A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,1331510400,Do You Want to Be a Published Writer?,"If you are interested in being a published writer, this magazine has excellent content on diverse aspects of writing.  A recent issue accented topics such as mastering voice, researching like a pro, story mistakes even good writers make and observations on writing by authors who have received the Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />There's usually a more extensive interview with a successful author--I enjoyed a recent interview with Mary Kay Andrews describing how she first started writing for publication.  It made me want to read her books after reading how she structured them.<br /><br />If you like reading about the field of writing, and are thinking of entering it or are writing already for publication, this magazine offers insight about the writing world from real writers.  It's a pleasure to read and will probably motivate you to start writing for publication or for the fun of it.",1
AE4PE48Q2794I,1251417600,"Just started my subscription again, and I'm glad","I just started to subscribe to Writer's Digest again after a few years of letting my subscription lapse. I'm glad I did. Although there are a lot of advertisements and some of the ads are for some pretty bad vanity presses, I understand that magazines need ad revenue to stay in business. I get it.<br /><br />The magazine is really targeted towards traditional publishing, but even self-published authors (like me) can learn something here. And some of the interviews are really great, even if just to gape at how some lucky authors get to live.<br /><br />The first issue I received was the August 2009 issue, and it had a pretty good ""Publishing Survival Guide"" in it. The interview was with Anne Tyler, and that alone was worth the price of the magazine. There's also a good interview with Rick Steves (I'm a huge fan). Interestingly, though, they decided to put Anne Tyler on the cover instead of Rick Steves. I thought that Rick would have been a better cover than Anne Tyler from a marketing standpoint.<br /><br />Anyway, the ads are a bother but the magazine is still worth it.<br /><br />Recommended.",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1219708800,Learn the Tools of the Writing Trade,"Writer's Digest is a magazine designed for writers and it attempts to cover many different aspects of writing in its columns and featured articles. Most every issue offers at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous author. This spotlighted author could be the author of a book, a screen writer, or some other type of author. These interviews offer some good insight into writing success and the necessary skills and sacrifices to succeed at your chosen craft.<br /><br />Aside from the interviews, Writer's Digest is basically a magazine of tips and advice. One issue might talk about ways to break into the business of movie reviewing for newspapers. Another might talk about ways to make your writing more concise and less wordy. Still another article might discuss ways to overcome writer's block. The main goal of Writer's Digest is to help the reader become a better writer and, hopefully, gain an offer for a publication at some point in the future.<br /><br />One thing that is a little different with Writer's Digest is that it doesn't contain the long list of standard monthly departments like you find in other magazines. With Writer's Digest, the departments are de-emphasized and there are only a few of them in each issue. The rest of Writer's Digest is dedicated to columns and featured articles. This format is unique and it makes Writer's Digest a good choice for those who like change and prefer to read something different in each issue.<br /><br />Writer's Digest does contain a pretty good number of advertisements, but the ads are usually for writing conferences, writing software, writing contests, or ads that encourage a visit to the magazine's own web site. Because the ads stay so focused on the subject of writing, they don't seem all that bad and they are not distracting. I know some Writer's Digest readers who actually look forward to the ads so that they can find information on the latest contests. And speaking of the magazine's web site, it seems to be an important component of the magazine because it is referenced on many pages throughout each issue.<br /><br />Writer's Digest is a pretty good magazine for writer and I like it for its advice and classified ads more than anything. The success stories can sometimes get a bit carried away and they make it look a little too easy to land a huge writing contract. It would also be nice if Writer's Digest was published monthly rather than semi- monthly. But Writer's Digest is still a good magazine for writers everywhere, with plenty of good advice and tips to help you become the writer you always knew you could be.",1
A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,1218585600,Best for the hobbyist or starting writer,"If you are making your living by writing you probably won't use this magazine as much as a hobbyist or a beginning writer.<br /><br />This magazine makes a nice gift subscription for friends or family who enjoy writing for a hobby. Each issue comes with 3-4 large features or how-to articles. These articles focus on different aspects of the writing life, including development, marketing and interviews with published authors, agents and editors of publishing houses.<br /><br />As other reviewers mentioned, most of the writing topics in this magazine and similar resources can be found online. That doesn't mean you should not buy a subscription as a gift.<br /><br />The magazine is perfect for an older person who is not comfortable with computers or someone who doesn't have access to a high-speed Internet service. The monthly assortment of articles helps to encourage and stimulate a beginning writer. There are gems for everyone that can be found in a one-year subscription to Writer's Digest.",1

Tennant. One of the four works pictured is broken down and shown in six stages, from the initial layout to the final delicate details.<br />Artist Joseph Frassetta explains his technique in ""Reining it In"", and tells us what materials and tools he uses to create his realistic portraiture and animal studies.<br />There is another article on landscape painting through the four seasons, and others on doing a self-portrait, mixing the use of colored pencils, and so much more. Some favorite monthly articles are ""Art Clinic"" and ""Technical Q&A"", which always have useful tips.<br />The back of the magazine has classified listings of art related opportunities, workshops, etc., and even the ads can be an informative resource.<br />The Artist's Magazine also sponsors a yearly competition, with many categories, including a student/beginner division.<br />The magazine has medium weight paper, good color reproduction, and  teachers and students, especially of a traditional style of art, will find much to enjoy and learn in every issue.",1

Gone are the extended articles on training, on doing your own repairs, touring, selecting components, profiles of racers and industry personalities. What's left is a slim magazine containing mostly ads disguised as articles, and justifications for buying disposable $10,000 carbon bike. The bulk of each issue is padded out with very short feature articles telling you things like wide tires are better than narrow ones for gravel,  how to signal turns with your arms, and that when you wash your bike, you shouldn't neglect the underside of the saddle. As  with so many other once-great publications, far more useful information is to be found on the forums, blogs, and manufacturer's sites on the net.",0

I've also tried every other parenting magazine during that time, and they pale in comparison to Parents.  Parents has great articles, real stuff that can help your real problems.  They've helped me immensely with my son's bedwetting, my daughter's potty training and picky eating, and everything in between.  I love the back of the magazine each month where it gives advice per age group.  I also love the photos and the funny mom stories.  Not to mention the great crafts and projects and foods to make!  Parents is very creative and I think every parent needs this magazine!  It is always my first gift to any new mom.",1

In addition to the great articles, product information, and pictures of cute kids, you will find disease, health and vaccine updates, product recalls and warnings about products that every parent should be aware of.<br /><br />On the lighter side, I love the pictures of the kids, ""Baby Bloopers"", and ""It Worked for Me!"" monthly sections.<br /><br />Also nice, in addition to a table of contents, there is an age-by-age guide included, which states what articles relate to each age, birth through 12 years of age.<br /><br />Highly recommend for all parents.",1
A26KYDJOAGI05S,1039478400,Monthly Motivation,"Runner's world is a very traditional magazine with geared towards mostly a middle-aged audience.  The authors manage to give the same advice every month and make it sound different.  That may be one of the things that makes this magazine so motivational.  I keep reading about people who have run every day for the last fifty years or who run in 30 below weather, and I wonder what's keeping me off the roads.<br />The Rave Run two page spread photographs are lovely.  They each show a runner in a really cool environment with a quote.  I have some of them hanging on my wall.  I get especially motivated by the one of a man running through the woods when the trees are coated with ice and the ground blanketed with snow.  It looks so beautiful, who wouldn't want to go out and run.  The ask the expert or Q&A section has the most diverse and informative information from month to month mostly because the questions come from readers and the answers come for a variety of experts.  The nutrition section isn't particularly useful.  The science seems simplified to the point that it isn't exactly true, and the suggested menu for one of the carbohydrate dinners starts out with 1 cup broiled swordfish along with five or six other things; not really practical in my opinion.<br />Runner's World has a nice coverage of racing events past (results) and future (racing calendars), and my hometown of Boulder, CO is mentioned somewhere at least once per issue :).  Runner's World encourages everyone to be a winner even if he or she doesn't finish first.  It is full of tips for beginners just staring to run and more advance information about training for seasoned amateurs.  Some of the information is useful and some is not, but there is enough useful information to make reading worthwhile.",1
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,1005868800,"Mix of Oprah, ""Sports Illustrated"" and ""Running Times""","Hardcore runners will read ""Runner's World"" because they have to. It popularizes the sport, and brings newcomers 'up to speed' about issues and techniques important to them, as well as clues them in on who is who out on the road. a great magazine, except I simply prefer the depth of training and racing issues ""Running Times"" provides a bit more. Really... I wish I could've given this magazine a 3.9.<br /><br />Running is a funky subculture, and ""Runner's World"" defines and educates that culture.<br /><br />Since the late George Sheehan wrote his famous column that emphasized running as spiritual endeavor, ""Runner's World"" has taken on an Oprah Winfrey/Deepak Chopra sort of generalist running philosophy. That's not all bad, as I think the magazine thoroughly encourages fitness through running.<br /><br />It isn't all fluff. There is plenty for the more avid runner to soak up. The avid runner will find their marathon coverage, especially Boston and New York, impressive.<br /><br />Their running shoes review is what any runner will benefit from.

A1RE4GU6S5ZF52,1131926400,Really enjoy and look forward to this.,I was given a subscription to this magazine during my pregnancy and have gaining a lot of knowledge on the baby world from it.  I enjoy the read and have picked up a lot of great ideas from it.,1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1098921600,Raising Kids in the Modern World,"Parents magazine is a very good publication about raising kids to be happy, healthy adults. It offers some good advice about the task of parenthood, illustrating the hard work and rewards that go hand in hand if parents perform their role in the best possible manner.<br /><br />I like this magazine as a whole, but there are a few things that potential readers need to know about before they pick up a copy to read. First of all, the articles in Parents magazine deal mostly with younger children, below twelve years of age. You won't find much of value in this magazine if you have teenagers. It is intended more for families with youngsters.<br /><br />Another thing about this magazine that makes it less practical than it otherwise would be is the suggestions for family activities. The ideas presented here are all pretty good, but the problem is that the majority of them involve outlays of cash and/or time that are unrealistic for most families. I can agree, for example, that adding a game room would make a nice addition to one's house and would add tremendously to a family's time spent together. But how many among us can afford a home addition? Parents magazine talks about activities and enhancements like this in an unrealistic way, making them seem much simpler and easier to implement than they really are.<br /><br />Aside from distractions like that, however, Parents is a very good magazine to read. It's one of the longest magazines you can buy, with 200 to 300 pages per issue. Add to that the low subscription price, a few pages of coupons, and the generally sound parental advice and you have all the makings of a good magazine for young families.",1

AEMZRE6QYVQBS,1190678400,mediocrity has its virtues,"Publications like BICYCLING practically define narrow-casting. Aimed at a modest population that throbs with interest in their shared pursuit, a magazine like this one has to meet elevated expectations and yet recruit enough advertisers to pay the bottom line and maintain an accessible price.<br /><br />The result is almost doomed to be something of a hybrid.<br /><br />In my book, that's just ok. I read BICYCLING as much for the gear as for the articles on new products, new workouts, and exotic rides. Some months, I'm in it for the advertisements, sometimes for the review, sometimes for the workouts, sometimes just for the sheer pleasure of turning the pages and seeing what I can see.<br /><br />That's what one should expect from a magazine like this one. It's not philosophy, not rocket science, and not a training manual for the Tour. It's just BICYCLING. That's pretty cool.",1
AYOMAHLWRQHUG,1268784000,Virtually Nothing but Ads,I'm glad my subscription is expiring.  I found nothing of use in 12 issues of this magazine.  Even the articles seemed suspect like the authors were given a list of products to promote.,0
A1TFOXCKW4JHIB,1021680000,A wealth of useful information,"This is primarily my wife's subscription, so this is mostly her input - she has me read a couple features each month.  There are so many things she finds useful about the magazine - I can tell you she spends several hours reading each issue and regularly cuts out articles to save in our ""parenting"" file or to put on the fridge.  Here are just a few of the great regular features of each monthly issue:<br />- ""As They Grow"", pointers and insights related to a particular subject, one each for eight different age groups (from pregnancy to pre-teen years)<br />- ""can you help?"", suggestions from readers about how to handle a common problem, such as the dentist or cutting your child's nails<br />- Suggestions to keep your child busy in the house<br />- An Emergency Guide pull-out for dealing with various situations like electrical shock, bee stings, etc.<br />- Product recalls, usually with pictures<br />- Product testing and reviews (similar to Consumer Reports)<br />Why not 5 stars?  There are a couple annoying features in the magazine, such as ""out of the mouths of babes"" and some of the suggestions for children's activities around the house sound easier to do than they really are (sort of like what people say about Martha Stewart).  It can also be a bit of a downer to read the stories about serious illnesses some children have had and how their families cope - not always what you're in the mood for when you're thinking about your own healthy child.  But overall, this magazine is the best one out there for parents AND they are branching out - we recently started receiving Baby Parents.  It's tough to know everything about raising your child so outside sources of information are key.  Parents magazine is a great resource that has been well worth the small subscription price.",1
A2KQ9FU7M6IX2X,1250208000,Not even worth a glace,"Every once in a while I will pick up Lucky magazine and everytime I feel ripped off. The clothing isn't crazy expensive like in Elle or Harper's Bazaar but what they pick for clothing is just not even trendy, its just ugly. I'm all for having an individual clothing style but their items are just not wearable in daily life. And their ""real life"" models have these extravagant jobs that allow them to spend high amounts on clothing and wear tacky shirts. And each one seems to have that faux bowlegged stance when showing off their clothes...I have to admit, their section on shoes and accessories is very good, lots of unique pieces to add to any wardrobe that won't break the bank.",0

I do not have a natural talent/eye for fashion. Yet, with the help and inspiration I find in ""Lucky"", I feel I am able to sustain a reputation as a well dressed person (at the same time staving off that frumpy look that so many women tend to adopt with the onset of middle age...).

You can also find ideas for Travel and Recreation, Garden and Outdoor Living, Home and Design and of course Food and Entertaining. The monthly columns are quite unique. Like in the December 2001 issue, Peter Fish wrote an article about The voice of Christmas which is about Bing Crosby.<br /><br />In the middle of the magazine, you can find a postcard that says: Information worth sending for. They do all the work for you...you just have to circle the information number to receive information on everything from International Travel to products you see advertised. They never leave you wondering where to find a unique product as they have a ""Sources: Where to Find It"" section.<br /><br />The Holiday Section always has me dreaming! Who would not want to walk on the Multnomah Falls Trail in Oregon or stand on a log bridge over a river and just dream a day away. Sometimes I would just like to dissolve into some of the pictures. Especially the last issue, where they showed a cabin in the woods with Christmas Lights in Stehekin, Washington.<br /><br />If you live in Washington, this is a MUST HAVE!<br /><br />The January 2002 issue has an article on kayaks and a recipe for French Cream with Blueberry Pudding.<br /><br />Reading this magazine is really almost a family traditon!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1106870400,Attention Female Shoppers,"This magazine is a product of CondeNet publishing and it is aimed at the younger female market, roughly from ages 18 to 30. This publication is a shopper's paradise, with more advertising than most any other magazine on the market.<br /><br />I got a complimentary subscription to this magazine one day and I accepted, not only because it was free, but also because I really didn't know it was a woman's fashion magazine. With a title like ""Lucky"", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn't know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.<br /><br />Fashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.<br /><br />If you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in- tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I don't see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross- section of the population.",1

If you are looking for absolutely anything else, you won't find it here. I do find it odd that this magazine actually costs money because mostly it just advertises things and tell you where to buy them. Lucky comes with a sheet of tab stickers that say 'yes' and 'maybe' to mark things that you are interested in buying. I had fun pulling them off and sticking them on things I'd like to have just like when I was a kid and I went through the toy catalog circling all the stuff I wanted.<br />Some of the items featured in Lucky are reasonable priced, but most are not. Apparently Elton John has a line of candles that includes a `Three hundred dollar one that's the size of a small water buffalo.' (Insert one of my 'yes' tab stickers here!) The styles do seem to be up to date and trendy, but the same information can usually be found in any other women's magazine in their advertisements, and in other magazines you actually get content. Lucky really is just a trendy catalog.",0

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,1362787200,Starting to slip...,"I have been a subscriber to Runner's World Magazine for the past four years.  I have watched, in dismay, the slow and sure descent of this magazine into the clutches of marketers.  Let me give you an example:<br /><br />Runner's World April 2013.<br />Page 46.  Magazine recommends eggs in an added on box in the bottom right corner of the page.<br />Page 67.  Magazine recommends eggs again stating that studies (which studies?) show that eating eggs helps reduce calorie intake.  Large picture of a fried egg.  Also several recipes recommend eggs (on the same page).<br />Page 45.  Paid advertisement for egg whites.<br /><br />Page 31.  Magazine recommends chocolate milk as an after workout recovery (gross!)<br />Page 67.  Magazine has picture of milk cartons, recommend fat free milk.<br />Page 74.  Magazine recommends chocolate milk again.  With picture this time.<br />Page 39.  Paid advertisement for chocolate milk.<br /><br />Seeing a trend?  It's sad really, because where is the line going to be drawn?  I don't mind the advertisements, but when the magazine starts working in recommendations based on what ads have been bought a particular month?  Will Runner's World recommend M&Ms as a post run recovery if Mars Candy Company puts in an add?  Granted chocolate milk and eggs aren't the worst... but seriously recommending eggs for a runner to lose weight?  Should we ignore the cholesterol and fat content?  Again, just picking on one thing, but I can see a trend starting to develop.<br /><br />That alone wouldn't be enough to completely turn me off the magazine though.  The ads have gotten more numerous it seems, and actual content has shrunk.  More of the content is being devoted to recipes and repetitive training tips.  Great for those who buy this magazine on occasion from the new stand, but not for subscribers.  The beginners' tips are getting so repetitive that I can predict exactly what will be recommended:<br />> Start out slow.<br />> Interval train.<br />> Post run stretch.<br />> Take days off when needed.<br />> Slowly add mileage.<br />> Back off if too sore or injured or strained.<br /><br />Also, the rave run section at the beginning?  A big glossy picture of a cool location I probably won't be able to run.  Newbie chronicles?  The stories can be humorous, but are usually just a recap of an run that a beginner took that inspired them to run more often.  There are usually a few recipes, but often they are geared towards meat eaters and don't have any really easy way to modify them for vegetarians or vegans.  I did see one recipe where the author mentioned subbing tofu and another ingredient to make it vegan.  But this is rare.  The shoe reviews have become a joke.  Basically you can expect several shoes to get 'awards' or a 'best update', but often they are incomplete comparisons and they do not have the user notes any longer.  (They used to include a few lines from testers about what they liked, now they just have one or two lines by testers per guide, not per shoe).<br /><br />The best section?  ""Ask Miles.""<br /><br />Also, periodically there are very good and inspiring stories.  But a lot of the stories are fluff.  It's just not worth a subscription anymore.  I bought the following book for cheap - MUCH cheaper than Runner's World was trying to sell it directly to subscribers for:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runner-s-World-Complete-Book-of-Running-Everything-You-Need-to-Run-for-Weight-Loss-Fitness-and-Competition/dp/1605295795/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runner's World Complete Book of Running: Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition</a>.  $15 brand new from Amazon.  The magazine e-mailed me a trial offer for this book with the final billed amount at $35.  Sad.  But my recommendation?  Until the magazine gets back to where it was 2+ years ago, skip it.  If you really want packed information about running and training, buy the book I mentioned.  At least it's ad free!<br /><br />My recommendation?  Stick to running gear ads and get away from food product ads, I think that is an area that makes money but also puts the magazine at the liberty of some of the most unscrupulous advertisers in the country (remember, food companies often pay grocery stores for better shelf space and for their products to be featured in ads and circulars).  I would also revamp the rave run section and have several (smaller) pictures of at least a dozen locations each month scattered around the country.  You could even ask readers to send in pictures and locations.  Give us a slice instead of blowing up one giant photo.  And with a selection, perhaps one of these runs might be close by.  Also have more stories and information for mid level runners.  More product reviews - the earbud reviews were nice, but there were only six or so.  That is not acceptable.  Give us 20+ earbuds and just list the ones that aren't recommended.  And try buying the products out of the budget rather than having vendors give them to the magazine.  I understand that is the nature of the game: ""want it reviewed?  Give it to us.""  But often this makes incomplete review guides.<br /><br />I don't want Runner's World to go the route Outside Magazine did several years ago.  Remember the readers and the runners are #1, not advertisers.  Give the magazine the old substance and pay attention to subscribers.  Don't sacrifice the quality overall just to appeal to those folks browsing the magazine rack at Barnes and Noble.  I have another year or so left on my subscription (silly 2 year renewal!), hopefully I will see a nice improvement in that time.  And I don't think I'm alone in this.",1
A1PGC1GEBY9CZU,1455321600,Their Articles Speak TO Me Instead of THROUGH Me,"This is a review of the magazine and NOT the subscription through Amazon.<br /><br />I had subscribed to Sunset several times over the years.  After moving to the Atlantic Coast side of the U.S., reading it was haphazard and only through an odd passing.  Fast forward nearly 40 years and I'm back on the Pacific side of the country where Sunset actually matters to me now.<br /><br />I've always like their writing.  It's an easy comfortable read without dummying it down so much I feel as though I'm being talked through instead of to.  Their articles seem to hit home for me.  Being an avid hiker, camper and backpacker (as well as retired chef), there seems to be many choices that speak directly TO me.<br /><br />Sunset magazine isn't going to shake up the world.

This magazine covers places from around the world of some of the best travel websites and hotels to stay at when you are traveling to many places in Europe, Asia, etc.  However, the one feature that I do LOVE about this magazine is how they feature a special issue just on Europe each year.  I treasure these ""special issues"" that cover Europe because places all across Europe are featured. For example, I feel very lucky to own the special issues that cover just Europe from the issues of May 2008, April 2009, and April 2010. The following are some of the features from these special issues that cover Europe:<br />1)In the May 2008 Travel+Leisure special issue of Europe there is a feature about the many travel gems to see in Vienna, Austria and 10 London, England restaurants that are recommended by British Food critic Paul Levy. There is also a fascinating article on ideas to consider for outdoor walking in France.<br />2) In the April 2009 Travel+Leisure Europe special issue there is a great feature on 22 Affordable European Hotels (my favorite visual feature is The Hotel Franziskaner in Zurich, Switzerland). There is a catchy article feature on the many places to visit in Lourdes, France.<br />3)In the April 2010 Europe feature there is a feature on Book Lover's London and a captivating article about Europe's best wine bars. I also like the 25 undiscovered European villages that are featured (the picture of the Staufen im Breisgau, a medieval town close to the Rhine Valley in southern Germany).<br />I very much look forward to the 2011 Europe Special issue that Travel+Leisure is going to create.<br /><br />  The following are some of the exciting features of the February 2011 issue of Travel+Leisure:<br /> 1) There is the feature of 25 of some of the most romantic dream trips (the country retreat of Coworth Park in Berkshire, England stands out in a good way for me).<br />2)There is a colorful article titled ""The Spirit of Dublin"" and some of the wonderful places to check out while in Dublin, Ireland (the cafe owner pictured on page 94 seems pretty joyful and content in her life).<br />3)On page 40 the fashion designer, hotelier, and Apprentice Star Ivanka Trump is featured.

AEMZRE6QYVQBS,1164931200,a room with a view,"As Cond Nast's chief rival in the affluent traveler sector of the glossy magazine industry, TRAVEL & LEISURE comports itself admirably. For those of us who have not yet considered buying a private jet, such affluent travel is more a spectator sport. Interesting, occasionally worth yelling about, but not something we'd put on our kit and run out on the floor to do for ourselves.<br /><br />This reviewer travels almost constantly as part of his work. As a result, I regularly brush up against the destinations T&L points toward, though only by accident or overbooking do I end up in the executive suites.<br /><br />Still, there is something here for both rich and, well, un-rich. For example, the December 2006 'insider' column on London's greenmarket neighborhoods is worth a look for anyone who finds Londontown a place, as do I, of bottomless fascination. P. 182's 'Guide to Cairo' manages a similar multi-class helpfulness and the fine treatment of northeastern Brazil is interesting on any budget.<br /><br />Plus, if you *can* manage the ching-ching for, say, the SEABOURN LEGEND on one of its French Riviera cruise, hey, you're in gravy. If you can't - like the Chicago Cubs - it's still fun to watch.",1

AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,1240185600,Best of the West,"I grew up in the Bay Area, went to college and lived for 10 years in the Sonoma area, and now reside in Las Vegas. I can tell you from experience the when Sunset writes about any of the above mentioned places they usually hit it spot on what to do and where to go. I was in SF this last weekend and both where I went for my burrito in the Mission District and when I went to Brite Rite for ice cram had their clipping from Sunset on the wall. I went to these places because I knew they were the places to go not because I read about them in Sunset, but it goes to show you Sunset does not steer you wrong.<br /><br />I have gone to several places mentioned in the magazine and was not disappointed. I would say that Sunset is best used as a travel guide. I also enjoy their food tips my wife and I typically try one receipe per month for the magazine. What I would like to see is more indepth articles that don't concern travel. I would also like to see a more extensive gardening section the few tips I get are nice but this section could be expanded",1

There is not one recipe that I have tried from this magazine that has not turned out great. The best part about the recipes is that it is usually fresh foods that are in season and are not difficult to find.<br /><br />It touches on home decorating and despite the name and despite being directed towards southwest living it is not the type of home deco you might expect. It is classic, stylish and modern decorating.<br /><br />There are travel ideas and it is usually something the whole family can afford. They are usually a little bit off the beaten path and feature something quirky, fun or plain interesting.<br /><br />Well worth the money. Enjoy.",1
ANEDXRFDZDL18,1148428800,Good... A little too comercial,"I've always thought of Sunset magazine as the type of magazine you'd find in the back of an airplane seat.  The kind of magazine with flashy pictures, expensive wines and places you can never afford to go to. This is a good magazine, but I find level of advertising annoying. Also, the reviews of hotels don't strike me as that reliable. Last month, based on a review in this magazine about an inn, we stayed the night at this location and found the service was awful, the 'rooms with fireplaces' not functional and the room smelled bad. These facts were conveniently left out of the review which touted the friendly staff and the great rooms. So I guess, ultimately, I'd take reviews and articles in the magazine with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I DO however like the recipes, particularly the ones which come out around harvest/Thanksgiving time.<br /><br />4 stars",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1137888000,Sunset Fills You With Visions of the Western U.S.,"Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.<br /><br />I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.<br /><br />One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.<br /><br />One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.<br /><br />One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the ""Value Vacation""- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.<br /><br />Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.<br /><br />Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.",1

For the price of a subscription one could learn, exp! ore, visit and understand nations, communities and peoples newly discovered and those long known.<br /><br />One of the most amazing things about National Geographic is how long some people hold on to them.  It is not uncommon to come across bundles from the 40s, 50s and 60s.

A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,1227916800,Don't do it! -- Pick one of these magazines instead,"Maxim rode the men's magazine gold rush in the late 1990s, leading Stuff, FHM and a host of other PG-13 fare that filled the convenience store racks as Playboy, Penthouse and the hard cores were either dropped completely or were tucked behind the clerk hidden behind individual black plastic wrappers.<br /><br />Maxim is the last Laddie still in print in the U.S., having witnessed the print burials for FHM (1996 to 2007) and Stuff (1998 to 2007). Maxim's putrefaction is evident to its subscribers, hence the heavily discounted subscriber rates available today. If you were unfortunate enough to receive a gift subscription to Maxim or, worse yet, bought one for yourself, you can no doubt bear witness to the decay.

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1081123200,Maximum Female Fun for Young Men,"Maxim is a monthly publication aimed at the younger male population, aged 16 to 30. This magazine offers a few amusing tidbits each month, like jokes and unusual ways to make things. There is an occasional fashion article, and some monthly articles on electronic gadgets and music. But the primary reason why people buy Maxim and the main reason it sells as well as it does is the women.<br />Maxim is not really an adult magazine, like Playboy or Penthouse. Its photographs do not expose so much that they should garner an X rating. But many of them come very close. From the picture on the cover (always a young woman, often with a seductive look in her eyes and much flesh exposed) to the photos in the middle, Maxim uses sex to sell. It isn't strictly a photo- op magazine for young women. There are interviews to accompany the visual effects. But the small talk is almost always geared toward sex- how to get it, how to keep getting it for a long time, how to improve your chances to get it, how to help friends get it, how to turn women on, etc.<br />The photos in Maxim are enticing, and I don't think any red- blooded American male would deny this fact. But what hurts Maxim a little bit and what keeps it from gaining as much respect as it could have is the monthly dose of stupidity that comes with each issue. Much of what you find in the ""How to"" section, for example, is idiotic and I cannot imagine anyone taking it seriously. The ""Bar Exam"" feature is also bordering on stupidity, with a set of trivia questions each month about some type of useless information.<br />Overall, I think Maxim is at least an average magazine, in spite of its flaws. Yes, many of the articles are brainless and the humor is the type that would amuse a 12- year old. But the main reason people buy and read (or should I say look) at Maxim is the photographs of the women. With so much flesh exposed, without going to far, Maxim is a publication with a purely visual bend. You won't find much intelligence here, but you will find plenty of photos of scantily clad women, tempting your hormones with their youthful good looks and uninhibited personalities.",1

I especially enjoyed reading Style & Design 2015, Secrets of a secret agent by Josh Eells and The lethal thrills of BASE jumping by Phil Klay.<br /><br />Other departments include: Record book, four-day week-end, adventure, travel, dispatch, food, spirits, fashion and essay.  I also enjoyed the health & fitness section explaining the facts about eating red meat. The last word column was also interesting with an interview with Merle Haggard. This magazine is aimed obviously at the young professional man who likes cars, tech tools and adventure hobbies.<br /><br />If you are into fashion, cars, high tech tools and adventure you should check out this mens magazine.<br />Rating: 4 Stars.

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292371200,The Discerning and Intellectual Cook's Magazine of Choice,"Bottom-Line: If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.<br /><br />The world of Men's magazines, or magazines that are marketed towards a certain portion of the male reading populace, is littered with twaddle that only seems to appeal to the baser instincts of the male gender.  You know the magazines; they need not be mentioned here.  Some are happily folding tent never to heard from again.  Truth be told there are very few magazines that appeal to the more intellectual side of a man (yes ladies we do have such a side).<br /><br />But recently as ""special gift"" for renewing my Bally's Total Fitness membership I received a 1 year subscription to ""Men's Journal Magazine"", ""a general interest, active lifestyle magazine with a focus on adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.""<br /><br />""Men's Journal Magazine"", is published monthly by Wenner Media, the same publishing house that brings us such notable sidewalk fare as Us Weekly and Rolling Stone.  The magazine will set you back $3.95 an issue at the local newsstand, but 1 year subscriptions can be had for $9.95.  Inside each approximately 120-page magazine you will not find half clothed women dripping with sexy come hither stares.  Nor will you find the next Hollywood ""it"" girl, or wannabe skinny model with a fake tan gracing the pages of this Men's magazine.  No, ""Men's Journal"" is serious business folks; vapid men with one track minds and adolescent libido's need not apply!<br /><br />""Men's Journal"" is a smartly written, thoughtfully designed magazine for the active intellectual male.  The magazine offer feature-length articles on a wide range of subjects based on the magazine's central theme: adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.<br /><br />However, like most magazines in America, ""Men's Journal"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, but unlike fashion magazines that seem to be 90% advertising and 10% substance, ""Men's Journal"" only dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is not dedicated to men's fashions, wore by young impeccably sculpted and groomed men, or automobiles that are impossibly expensive, but instead to the business of adventure and sports.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Men's Journal Magazine.""  Granted, given my current lifestyle (my days of adventures have been traded in for the American Dream and all that entails for now), the information the magazine imparts is only marginally useful to me.  The fitness articles are rater short and are mostly how-to's that while useful are just barely so.  Most of the equipment discussed in Men's Journal is for the magazines target audience with the appropriate disposable income; that's not me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, when my subscription runs out in another ten months I will probably renew.  Why?  Because ""Men's Journal"" represents my kind of man: thoughtful, intelligent, adventurous (hey, I used to ride submarines, hike mountains and scuba dive and I still want to go sky-diving), man who actually appreciates full-length feature articles or two written by grown-ups for grown-ups.<br /><br />If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.",1

That's a pretty good shot at the content, since it takes your average young rich guy's (or no-longer-young-in-the-mirror rich guy's) desires to live a little on the wild side and decks them out in luxury opportunities to do just that.<br /><br />The writing is surprisingly good. We're not talking the Atlantic Monthly here, but recent issues have easy-on-the-eyes features on the crisis in Darfur, the late Aussie croc-wrestler Steve Irwin, and the down-in-the-mouth financial situation of our National Parks system.<br /><br />Like most magazines of the genre, the gloss, paper quality, and color make this an easy read in an airplane seat or an easy chair: Men's Journal is pleasant to the touch, good for some mild distraction, and leaves no bitter aftertaste.",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1098316800,It's What Men Like to Read,"Men's Journal is a decent magazine full of varied topics of interest to men. This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.<br /><br />One thing about Men's Journal that is a little different from other men's magazines is that it doesn't flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.<br /><br />Men's Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, Men's Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.<br /><br />This magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think Men's Journal is a good magazine.

If you are creative, you are never afraid, because you can design yourself out of any situation."" ~Li Edelkoort<br /><br />If you are interested in items like the Nissan Actic Concept Car (that has a matching trailer) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom, kitchen or garden, this magazine delivers.<br /><br />DWELL has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef. For example, the April/May 2004 issue had articles on:<br /><br />Home Cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home.<br /><br />Cutting It Up - A downtown Los Angeles loft gets a makeover.<br /><br />Stainless Chef - Designer John Picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub.<br /><br />Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations.<br /><br />Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism.<br /><br />Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern.<br /><br />Well, until I can afford a 9,500 buck oven, I'll keep reading and dreaming. The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore.<br /><br />Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color. The Marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design, house or otherwise.

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1257120000,Dwell Magazine Offers Unique Designs for the Home,"My mailbox overflows with magazines and among the themes, home and home- related topics are the most common. Dwell Magazine ranks as one of the better home magazines I read each month and it is one of only a few publications that I will return to throughout the month for entertainment and other purposes.<br /><br />What makes Dwell a unique publication is its dedication to more interesting and unusual home remodeling and rebuilding ideas. Other modern home magazines exist, but Dwell Magazine takes the idea of modern to a slightly different level than other, similar publications. With Dwell Magazine, the reader is presented with unusual homes, both on the exterior and interior, and many of them are certainly eye- catching, if nothing else. This magazine is all about homes that offer distinction and some of the design ideas are very interesting and will stick with you for a long time.<br /><br />Probably the most unique fact about Dwell Magazine is that, while it focuses on unusual and creative home design, it manages to maintain a level of livability. Other magazines that focus on unusual things- whether it's the home or something else- often take the weirdness factor to the extreme and they end up alienating most readers. But Dwell Magazine avoids making this mistake. The ideas it presents are unusual and creative, but still within the boundaries of taste and practicality.<br /><br />Magazines usually offer articles that cover a large range of topics each month, but one other interesting aspect of Dwell Magazine is that each magazine is based on a specific theme. This theme is clearly spelled out on the front cover, directly under the magazine's name, in bold letters. This is nice because you already have a good idea what to expect when you open the pages of any issue. The featured articles for the month will stick to the main theme for that particular issue.<br /><br />Dwell Magazine is one of hundreds of publications that focus on the home, but it easily stands out in the pack and I rank it among my favorites in this genre. I'm not into home design on a do-it-yourself level, but I do like to look at homes and the rooms within homes and I am always open to new ideas. Dwell Magazine offers plenty of creative ideas every month and it's a good magazine to consult for home makeover plans.",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1128124800,The Many Challenges of Business Ownership,"Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.<br /><br />On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.<br /><br />Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled ""Sources"" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.<br /><br />Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day.",1
A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,1180742400,My Favorite Design Magazine,"""Dwell"" is my favorite of all the design magazines I read regularly. It is a beautiful magazine with thoughtful and helpful illustrations, great articles, and interesting features. I am especially fond of the coverage of emerging trends in contemporary homes, particularly the coverage of prefab homes, culminating in the sponsorship of the ""Dwell Homes,"" which showcase outstanding contemporary prefabricated housing.<br /><br />The advertisements are consistently relevant and interesting, and the magazine is good at keeping its edge with articles about relevant home furnishings, appliances, and other items that are frequently overlooked in other design magazines. I love the ""Modern Market"" section in the back of the magazine, dealing with unique products that are well targeted to the fan of the contemporary aesthetic. My only minor complaint is the occasional political agenda that appears in the articles, but it is relatively infrequent and confined to only a few (of a large number) of the contributors, like Pagan Kennedy. In general, though, the articles stay on topic and the editorial content is relevant and appropriately focused.<br /><br />I look forward to getting several design magazines every month, but can honestly say that ""Dwell"" is my favorite of the bunch. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in contemporary architecture or design.",1

AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,1260489600,A bit on the high end side for ideas,"My wife subscribes to just about every food magazine that there is from Food Network, to Rachel Ray to Better Home and Gardens.  Not a week goes by that she is not clipping new receipes.  Food and Wine is our newest subscription and my first opinion is that it is more of a high end / refined  taste buds with more of elaborate meal planned than say a quick meal from Rachel Ray.  The pictures that accompny the receipes and stories are of the highest class and this magazine would be a great add to a coffee table or waiting room.  There are also stories about restraunts and vacations that center around eating.  I feel that the wine part of the magazine takes a back page to the food and would like to see more wine reviews (similar to wine spectator).  All in all buy this magazine to look at and read but if you are just a regular guy with normal tastes this magazine is not that practical.",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1106006400,"Good Eats, Fine Drinks, and Having Fun","Food and Wine is a pretty good magazine for those who enjoy the finer things in life when it comes to unusual cuisine and expensive fermented beverages. This publication is usually very long- over 250 pages- and its packed full of recipes, travel excursions to wine growing regions, and general facts about different varieties of wine and where to find them.<br /><br />One thing about this magazine that surprised me at first is the emphasis on the food. I know the magazine is titled ""Food and Wine"", but my initial impression was that this would be a magazine devoted entirely to wine with occasional mention of the foods that go with wine. It isn't like that at all. The food sections and the recipes are just as important as the featured wines. Recipes are so frequent, in fact, that the magazine even has an index located near the front with all the recipes listed by food type, showing the page number to turn to for the recipe.<br /><br />Besides the frequent talk about food and wine, this magazine is also dedicated to entertaining. I have heard it suggested that this magazine should change its name to ""Food, Wine, and Entertainment"". It would make sense, because conviviality and high- class partying are certainly an important component of this magazine.<br /><br />There is one thing about Food and Wine that I wish was different. I appreciate the factual information and I like the personal touch that you find in some of the stories about winery owners, chefs, and the like. But I think Food and Wine gets a little too sidetracked from time to time in its reporting. For example, it is common to find stories that talk about subjects like home decorating. This would be fine in a magazine about home design, but I don't think it belongs in a magazine like this.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a good publication. Lovers of great eats and fine drinks will enjoy it the most. It's worth taking a look, if nothing else, just for the recipes. Even if you're not a frequent imbiber of the fruit of the vine, there is still something of interest to be found in the pages of this magazine.",1

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292284800,The Discerning and Intellectual Cook's Magazine of Choice,"Bottom-Line: A glossy well put together magazine ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is well worth the subscription that is if you are a serious cook.  And even a not so serious one.<br /><br />The world of cooking, gourmet and otherwise magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with tempting dishes of un-nameable foods we are supposed to enjoy preparing. But ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" has them all whipped with its life-sized scrumptious looking delicacies begging to be devoured.  For instance the June 2008 issue has a picture of a Cheddar Burger with Chipotle Ketchup; the life-sized burger looks absolutely delectable.<br /><br />""Bon Appetit Magazine"", which bills itself as a food and entertaining magazine, is published monthly by Conde Nast Publications Inc. and is aimed at serious-minded cooks who passionate about the dishes they prepare.  They, like me are interested in what new in the world of cooking; not only that but they, like me have a keen interest in straying from the norm in the dishes they cook.<br /><br />Unfortunately like most magazines in America, ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is dedicated to cooking and the stuff of cooks.<br /><br />Bon Appetit Magazine Contents<br /><br />""Bon Appetit Magazine"" --a monthly publication--is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information and divided up in the following sections:<br /><br />o Fast, Easy, Fresh<br />o Family Style:<br />o At the Market<br />o Cooking Life<br />o Health Wise<br />o Wine & Spirits<br />o Prep School<br />o Features<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />A glossy well put together magazine ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is well worth the subscription that is if you are a serious cook.  However, even the not-so-serious cook will find something within the folds of the gorgeous magazine.  When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" not only because of the well put together articles and outstanding recipes, but also because the food look so darned inviting!  How come my dishes never turn out looking like the cover of a magazine?<br /><br />While I have to admit that some of the recipes are a little out there, the ones I have prepared have turned out well enough.  Be prepared you will have to shop for these ingredients; the average ""Bon Appetit"" recipe does not use your usual American kitchen staples.<br /><br />For instance in the June 2008 issue a recipe for Hazelnut-crusted chicken with raspberry sauce calls for lightly packed fresh raspberries, safflower oil, chopped hazelnuts, panko (Japanese breadcrumbs), and finely chopped mint leaves; not exactly stuff one might find at the local Jewel.<br /><br />Did I mention that the photography in ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is a feast in-and-of-itself?  No doubt there is a healthy dose of staging and a whole lot of Photoshop behind the gloss, but the effect is real enough.  Ready to pick one up yet?",1

Some are good. Some quite poor. I'm always a little hesitant to rely on a recipe from this magazine for a dinner unless I've tested it first and seen that it worked well for me. Bon Appetit recipes can be quite complicated and its a disappointment to spend so much time cooking a meal and have it turn out bland.<br /><br />Overall, while I will continue to subscribe to Bon Appetit, I suggest using caution on relying on their recipes too much. Also, I feel the adverts, interviews, and other ""Filler"" material is beginning to lean a bit towards the elitist side of the cooking market and is becoming less accessible to the average non-pro cook.",1

Other than tv, ""Bon Appetit"" is one of my main sources I refer to that inspires me to create my next meal. I have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now. I have to admit I don't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that I read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas. Some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue (I love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years) and Thanksgiving. What I am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end. From my point of view, a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make. I am blessed to live in a big city where I can find most of the ingredients but if I lived in a smaller city or town, it probably would be difficult to find.  These recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed. All in all, I still enjoy reading ""Bon Appetit"" and being inspired by the magazine.",1

I like that these recipes are everyday recipes that have been taken up a level or two.  Articles are informative, with discussing a particular food, ingredient, or technique.  I love the artistic photography.  This strikes me as a balance between Gourmet, and Cooking Illustrated.  This beats cooking illustrated for the photography and the depth of the recipes in each issue.  I highly recommend this one!",1

Looking in a recent issue about global warming and population increase in Bangladesh, the pictures illustrate the point of the story: the struggles of many impoverished citizens in a country in the grip of climate change.<br /><br />The stories have gotten less 'preachy' and don't tend to berate folks for not doing everything they can to help those in need.  Instead the stories tend to show both outlooks on a divided issue without painting one in a bad light.  Of course, the reader can usually infer from the nature of the story the outlook that Nat Geo favors.  It is a highly liberal magazine focused on conservation, but that is what they have been about for years, so it shouldn't surprise anyone.<br /><br />I highly recommend this magazine for those folks looking for great stories on a variety of topics pertaining to nature, history, and people.",0
A1T17LMQABMBN5,1010620800,"Provocative stories, provocative covers","Vanity Fair is one of my favorite magazines. I admire its bravery in its approach to journalism. A mixture of hard-hitting and tabloid writing, I must admit that it takes a lot of courage to tell it like it is -- to the dismay of some of the celebrities who agree to be interviewed for this magazine. It certainly pays off if they're looking for some serious publicity stunts (take Demi Moore for example). As a journalist, I subscribe to this magazine for inspiration. It takes a lot of guts to publish a no-holds-barred magazine like this one!",1

A24ZEH6X4AJNR4,1311033600,Best magazine in so many ways!,"As a child, I found this magazine when I couldn't pronounce ""geographic"", and adored the brilliant photography, scenery, strange-looking people and places, and was soon struggling to understand the text.  My imagination was seized by the Mayans, by the Caves of Lascaux, and always by dinosaurs and the other exotic plants and animals they showed me.  When I was a teenager my parents let me deface their old magazines to illustrate my papers on India, Japan, and anthropology.  I wanted to be an archeologist until I found out I'd have to learn a lot of languages, so history was a better choice for me.  Travel, geology, photography, and reading became passions.  Even as an adult, I sit down with the magazine and read it cover to cover the day it arrives, no matter what else I'm reading then.  Whenever I stumble on really old copies (the magazine is well over a century old), I read them to see how the magazine's point of view has developed.  This magazine has truly enriched my life.  My parents tried me out on various other magazines on nature, but this one is the real deal, and never talks down to me.<br /><br />If you're interested in the world, the universe, the past, the future, and in life, this is the magazine for you.  Even though they have NG magazines for various ages of children now, a curious, eager child could appreciate the real one by ten.",1

They have recently won multiple ellie's the equivalent of the Pulizer prize in the magazine industry.<br /><br />Each issue includes one or two features articles from around the world. While the magazine contains advertisements, they have placed ads in the front and back of the magazine so that feature articles are not interrupted by an annoying gaudy ad, a practice often seen in other magazines. The quality of the photos are simply amazing; the magazine uses a high quality paper to print quality photos not seen in any other magazine out there.<br /><br />It is not fair that other reviewers, provide a lower rating for this magazine because it can be found cheaper elsewhere.

Stories about wildlife, different cultures, and even environmentalism and the politics it breeds can be found on the pages within each issue.<br /><br />What makes this magazine so enjoyable is the fact that it goes so in- depth in its coverage and includes stories with a personal element. When most people think about National Geographic, they usually think about the great photographs of natural wonders, exotic plants, and animal wildlife. These things are all great, but they form only part of the magazine's overall appeal. Stories about different cultures and peoples from around the world are just as good, and are usually presented in a personal way. You feel like you know the people on an intimate level when you read this magazine.<br /><br />This publication contains between 120 and 160 pages in most issues, with about a dozen or so monthly departments, as well as some varied articles that change each month, but are always concentrated on nature, science, politics, culture, etc.<br /><br />National Geographic is often very educational and intellectual, making it a learning device as well as a magazine for entertainment.

Their concern for the environment is obvious but the magazine also covers people who have to live off the land like the indigenous people in the Artic. There is always two sides to every story. I also enjoy reading about other cultures from around the world, like Japan and China. After reading this magazine for over two decades, I find myself still entertained by National Geographic.

It is also a wonderful reference magazine for school children and the incessant projects that they must complete.

I usually flip through this magazine in a fairly short time.  However, every once in awhile there is a fascinating, heavily researched article.  The last I can remember is an indepth feature several years ago about the contemporary art scene before the financial bubble burst. Great stuff.  Otherwise, I can't see this magazine lasting another five years in print... Mostly flash, little substance.<br /><br />Edit:  Add another excellent article:  April 2013 issue, A Tale of Two Londons, an expose of the City of London Corporation, a city within a city, where ""lax regulation and lax enforcement"" allow dirty money from, for example, Third World dictators, Russian oligarchs who fleeced Russia's resources, and  American bankster gamblers to escape taxes and laws from their home lands.

Martha's magazine is always filled with beautiful images and great-looking recipes. her suggestions for housekeeping, gardening, and decorating are always tasteful and useful. I particularly like her holiday recipe selections.<br /><br />My main complaint about her magazine are the recipes. The food looks great, but the recipes I've made are fairly on the bland side and overcomplicated. I immediately pass over recipes with ingredients I cannot find in the supermarket or recipes which require 7-10 eggs and endless beating. I have come to the conclusion that I prefer recipes which are spicier than Martha does and desserts which are less frou frou. In fact, I prefer her FOOD magazine for recipes.<br /><br />4 stars.

Her basic table settings tend to be white china (one can use mix and match white plates from the local thrift store), clear glass, and colorful fabric...add some well shaped twigs in a glass vase for a centerpiece, and voila ! you have a table that could be shown in this lovely magazine; a rule for ""The Look"" seems to be the absence of clutter.<br />Of the regular monthly articles, I like ""Ask Martha"", which solves problems posed by readers, from health issues to how best to clean your eyeglasses, to ""How can I get the coating on my chicken to stay in place when I am frying it ?"".<br />""Clip-Art Craft"" is another I appreciate, where in the August '04 edition for example, there are attractive templates for postcards, which one can copy onto card stock, glue a 4 x 6 photo to, and send to your friends. It's another grand idea from Martha !<br />You'll find articles on antiques, pets, gardening, seasonal fruits and vegetables, and much more, and on the last page, the yummy ""Cookie of the Month"".<br />Martha Stewart has brought style and good merchandise at affordable prices for those of us who are budget conscious, but like nice things. I have bought her bedding, and her bathroom accessories have graceful shapes and are an excellent value, and this magazine is one of my favorite aspects of the ""Martha industry"".

One wallop with one of these babies rolled up, and you're more than likely going to do some damage. OK, as for the contents, it's hard to beat this magazine. Great recipes, outstanding crafts and ideas for special occasions. To say Martha is good at coming up with inventive ideas is putting it lightly. She borders on sheer genious (did I spell that right?). And the photography isn't something to bark at either, especially the ones of the different deserts and other dishes she comes up with. They can literally make your mouth water! Like any magazine, there's the tons of ads, but not to the point to where there's a small percent of reading, and the rest, ads. I love her Halloween and Christmas editions the most. They are filled with great ideas that I (and others in my family) have used. Anyone, single or family, can benefit greatly from this superb magazine.",1
A5RHZE7B8SV5Q,1078531200,About as thick as Vogue.,"Yes most issues are as thick as Vogue, which of course means like 50 pages of ads, before you get to the first page of text, but overall, I'm really impressed with their articles. They write about a variety of topics, and I thought it was great, how in the March (current) issue, the Editor In Chief, decided to use his column, to show the names of everyone who's died since the war in Iraq began, and where they were from, and what rank they were. It was really sad seeing these guys who were only 19, and they had their whole life ahead of them still. (Of course, these were all the people who had died as of press time for the issue). I believe the count was 472, and that has risen by almost 100, but it was still a very nice gesture. So what genre is Vanity Fair in exactly? Well, first off, don't let the name fool you and don't think just because when you first open it and you come to your first perfume sample, that it is only a magazine for women. Because further on in, they also have male models, so it's kind of for both genders. Some might say it's an Entertainment mag, but I hear it's just General Interest, and that's why it's not in the women's magazine section of my local grocery store, and it's just to the right of the Entertainment ones, so apparently, it's General Interest, and it means it's for anyone. You really shouldn't be ashamed to get it, like I first was. EDIT 3/13/04: After recieving the new issue today, I'm completely sure it more for women that anyone else.",0
A26KYDJOAGI05S,1038096000,Searching for Content,"This magazine has quite in depth articles about a wide variety of `general interest' topics.  I found many of the articles to be a bit longer than they should have been and they just drag on towards the end. The content reminds me of Reader's Digest for a slightly younger generation.  There are occasional racy topics and cursing, but not enough to turn me off.  Examples of topics in one issue:  Jewish power and peril, an architect, a sex club, September 11, Vanity Fair covers, and some common monthly features.  At least half of the magazine is fashion advertisements, and because of the amount of advertising, the magazine weighs a lot and is not useful for bringing anywhere.  If the articles were of a proper length and there was a normal amount of advertising, this magazine would be the size of any normal magazine, the rest is just filler.",1

I LOVED this magazine for all of it's ideas and recipes.<br />It's typical Martha Stewart fashion but at the price of how much it cost me to get it directly from her web-site I let it drop. Amazon[.com] offers a much better price but right now there are so many Magazines out there like this one that you almost can just subscribe to her web-site and get the same info without the cost.<br />The articles were okay.... there was so much advertisment in the issues I got that I felt like I wasn't getting the true body of what I wanted. Pictures are Great but if you are subscribing for the recipes come to Amazon[.com] and buy her books, trust me it is less clutter than all of those magazines which are quite thick.<br />Respectfully Reviewed",1

As a tester of equipment, I can think of non other than Consumer Reports who are as thorough.<br /><br />Backpacker magazine offers the known and lesser known hikes.  Any suggested would make for a great trip.",1
AKX8OYVWM0FDZ,1397260800,Great information that fits perfectly in my purse.,I found it here at $5.00 a year special.  It fits in my purse. When its handy while I'm in waiting rooms. The articles are short to the point. The initial delivery was as estimated and its reliable each month. I check out monthly specials for magazines in our home. I also renew when the magazine goes on special again. It just adds to the length of subscription. Also subscription are easy to managed right here on amazon. I've changed addresses a couple of times since the magazines have started. With no problems.,1

A2DJFYBB2L5VSN,1354147200,Going downhill slowly...Not what it used to be!,"I love hiking and the outdoors. I've always enjoyed reading backpacker and three years ago, I subscribed for three years. Now, my subscripiton is coming to an end. I almost didn't renew, as with other magazines of late, the quality is going downhill and the magazine has lost about 20 pages. It is not what is used to be. There seems to be a trend out there, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a cerain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazine shrink the issues without any notice what so over. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I don't know. For this reason, I didn't want to pay a lot to renew. I figured I'd renew for one more year to give it a chance, and see where the magazine is headed. Happily, the price at Amazon.com beat the renewal/new subscription prices offered by Backpacker magazine itself. Imagine that. Hopefully, Backpacker goes back to where it was, instead of where it seems to be going. If it doesn't, it'll be another magazine I will not renew. You'd think the publishers would want to keep the subscribers they do have, but they don't. I know because I have contacted editors of a few magazines: Smart Computing for one and the editor first asked me what I missed. When I told him, he couldn't care less. What a bad attitude! Needless to say, I cancelled my three subscription and received a refund, only partial because they wanted to keep all my money.",1
A35W3JQYP0M655,1337126400,Love It......Always Have,"I have subscribed to Backpacker for more than a dozen years now.  Although I have tinkered with other outdoor, hiking magazines over the years, I have always held this one as my favorite.  In my opinion nobody does it better when it comes producing a publication for hikers and campers that just can't get enough of the great outdoors.  One thing I have always liked about this magazine the most is how it never fails to regularly return to the basics.  That is to say, it doesn't always assume that you are a seasoned hiker that well understands the joy and dangers of just getting away from it all in the wilderness.  It regularly carries a generous amount of articles and regular features that are fundamental enough for the novice reader or backpacker, as well as stories that deal with easier, family style hikes. It truly isn't all about just zeroing in on the big bear country adventures that the seasoned backpacker will prefer.  Though its true that there are more glossy style ads in it than ever before, as well as pull out subscription order cards and ads, (what magazine doesn't these days), it still in my opinion sticks to its guns very well in being a very interesting and excellently written magazine that I enjoy as much today as I did years back when I could actually do some of the hikes that it talks about.  I highly recommend Backpacker for its quality articles and photography, and tenaciousness in staying with what made it a great magazine all these years... : )",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1067817600,Flawless Publication for Lovers of the Great Outdoors,"Backpacker is an outstanding magazine for those who love to hike and also for those who enjoy paging through a magazine containing lots of enticing photographs of nature scenes. This magazine is, first and foremost, a publication for lovers of the outdoors and the sport of backpacking. But the pictures of mountains, lakes, streams, wildlife, etc., are enticing to anyone. They can quickly convert the non- outdoorsman type into a nature lover.<br />Besides the great pictures, Backpacker is also excellent for its product testing and for its advice and educational material. Backpacks, mountain bikes, tents, and so forth might seem like simple products, but you would be surprised at how many different varieties and options are available for this type of merchandise. Backpacker describes different items available for sale, complete with web site address and phone# so you can make a purchase, and it often conducts tests to see how the different products stack up. It also offers educational material on the sport of backpacking and general advice on such topics as food, exercise, proper nutrition, first aid, etc.<br />Backpacker averages between 90 and 120 pages in total length and it's published 9 times per year (three of the issues combine two months into one). It's one of the few special interest magazines I have read that has something to offer most anyone. Even if you don't like hiking, there is still a good chance you will enjoy thumbing through the pages of Backpacker, if nothing else, just to enjoy the great photography.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding outdoor publication. The articles, the personal stories, the advice, the photos, and the educational material all add up to a perfect magazine for anyone who loves to partake in outdoor activity or who just enjoys looking at the stunning photos. 5+ stars to Backpacker!",1
A2V41G00X32X8O,1308096000,Prevention Magazine,"I love the magazine but hate that they sent me 2 back issues that I already had when my subscription started.  The latest Prevention has been on the stands for a week, and I have still not received it.",1
AKMEY1BSHSDG7,1255132800,Mega-Disappointment!,"Warning -- If you are looking for the Prevention Magazine that you remember reading back in the 1970's or 1980's -- THIS ISN'T IT!<br /><br />Gone are the wonderful articles on health by way of the PREVENTION of disease, replaced by advertisements for DRUGS and useless ""fashion magazine"" type stories that are filled to the brim with NOTHING of any value to the astute reader. The original publisher of Prevention must have run into financial difficulties, and perhaps sold the name to another company. This magazine bears absolutely no resemblance to the informative, educational publication it once was. I noticed years ago that it started slipping in the value of information presented, but this is just a joke! I'd compare it to a print version of all those endless commercials on TV for perscription medications, showing young, hip people in positive situations, while a voice-over drones on with an endless list of side-effects including death.<br /><br />If you are looking to educate yourself about the prevention of disease, by all means avoid this useless publication. It is completely without value, unless you happen to have a short leg on your coffee table.<br /><br />Yes, it's that bad. Stay away!",0
AE4PE48Q2794I,1251417600,Not what it used to be... Very poor quality,"Like some of the other reviewers, I used to subscribe to Prevention many years ago. I purchased a few issues from the newsstand and I am so disappointed. There is a preponderance of advertisements for drugs. Prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, articles about drugs. Everything in this magazine is about drugs, not natural health and healing. At this point, they might as well accept cigarette ads.<br /><br />Whatever happened to eating right and staying thin? What about vitamins and healthy foods? Nope. Just drugs. Diet pills to make you thin, sleeping pills to help you sleep, and every other drug you can think of. Lots of ads and very little substance.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.",0

A3R7MXVQRGGIQ9,1439942400,An interesting and informative magazine for anyone who lives in the Midwest part of the country.,"My wife and I are voracious readers.  We read the papers every day, as well as books and magazines.  This magazine (Midwest Living) focuses on living in the Midwest but has articles and features that may be of interest to anyone no matter where you live in the U.S.  I just finished reading the June/July 2015 issue which had some interesting and informative articles and departments.  The following is just an example of the material in this magazine:<br />Notes of the North was about the beautiful music, art, and wilderness of the Apostle Islands in Bayfield, Wisconsin. Flower power showed some of the floral fabrics, wall papers and accessories that brighten up a home. Viva Mexican night gives 14 delicious recipes you can spice up your dinner time.  They also have shorter articles on travel, the Midwest life, discoveries, events worth writing for and reflections.  Even though this is a magazine that appeals to women more then men, it often has articles and features men might enjoy reading as well.  It is also reasonably priced at about $2.00 an issue when you subscribe.<br /><br />If you live in the Midwest you might want to check out this magazine.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J.

AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,1393200000,Great for all levels of birders!,"I never really thought I would get into bird watching.  Than I went to Belize anad after that Costa Rica and signed up for some bird watchiing tours and became hooked.  Next I got my own binouclars, started putting up feeders and taking walks with the purpose of finding birds. Finally figuered I needed to read up on the hobby of bird watching and I found Bird Watches Digest.  First of all it is a bit smaller than I would like and thus a little bit hard on my eyes (about the size of an old tv guide).  However it was filled with lots of great information and stories.  As a novice bird watcher in Las Vegas some stories and articles just did not relate to me and one or two articles per magazine were too detailed for my liking.  But all in all the issues are informative and well done and I have kept all my issues for future reference.  This is a great magazine for anybody who enjyoys watching birds from the casual weekend birder to the die hard watcher who wants to do a big  year.",1
A2C07PJHRZ7SKL,1390521600,BIRD LOVERS UNITE,NICE BLEND OF INFORMATION. THIS PUBLICATION IS FOR BEGINNER AND ADVANCED BIRD WATCHERS! GREAT INFORMATION AND TIPS. I LOVE & RECOMMEND THIS MAGAZINE!,1
A35W3JQYP0M655,1253404800,Good Compact Magazine...,"Bird Watchers Digest is in my opinion a must have magazine for anyone that has any interest in birds.  From the backyard feeder to the world traveler observer, BWD has enough content in all areas to satisfy anyones particular interest, on any level.  There is even a regular section in each issue dedicated to back yard birding.  It isn't a magazine that is at all snobby and considers back yard novices peasants.  On the other hand, it is also a very technical and educational periodical for those that are advanced enough to actually take advantage of the many world wide travel suggestions and deals that are offered throughout the book. I first picked up some BWD back issues on Ebay and enjoyed it enough to order a regular subscription.  I was particularly impressed by its compact size, similar to Readers Digest.  It can be easily carried along in a purse or bag for traveling, and of course it makes a perfect addition to your bathroom library. The only caution that I would suggest to anyone that decides to buy a subscription is to pass on the offer of the digest newsletter that you can subscribe too for every other month that BWD isn't offered.  At $16 a for 6 issues it is not worth it at all.  Its a very thin, (about 10 pages) pamphlet style publication that has as many ads in it as helpful info.  Its a rip off in all honesty. I let my own subscription to it lapse after the first year.  You are much better off subscribing to the BWD email that is sent out periodically that is free, and loaded with article highlights and helpful info.  Overall I highly recommend BWD for all bird enthusiasts on all levels.  I think you will find yourself looking forward to each and every issue...",1
AEMZRE6QYVQBS,1229817600,a bit like a chickadee,"With the size and appearance of a slimmed-down READER'S DIGEST, the less famous BIRD WATCHER'S DIGEST is a chirpy little optimist of a magazine not so very different from, say, a black-capped chickadee.<br /><br />Short and moderate-sized articles cover specific species, how-to/techniques, choosing the right birding equipment, and joy-of-birding anecdotes.<br /><br />Advertisements abound but do not overwhelm.

One would certainly hope that little girls are not yet interested in ""what boys really want,"" and getting a good ""bikini body."" Parents -- don't choose this magazine for a child!<br /><br />Aside from the publisher's mis-information regarding the target audience, this is an entertaining and fun magazine for high school or young college girls. Of course, it's heavy on the advertisements, but those are the advertisements for all the stuff that teens are interested in. When I read teen magazines as a kid, I drooled over those ads for stuff I dreamed about having! It was just fun, and didn't warp my perception of reality or my position in the world. Don't mistake this for literature or high art -- this is just a little brain candy and fluff to pass the time. As that -- it's a sure hit as a gift for the teen in your life!<br /><br />Recommended as a fun distraction for your busy, stressed and overworked teens!",1
AOR590VF8YI5J,1073692800,Girls' Life is...okay,"I first encountered Girls' Life at my friend's house, an avid reader. Flipping through the magazine, I saw some good, okay, and bad features. Girls Life is targeted to ages 10-15, and it's good for those parents who feel as though their kid is too old for American Girl but still not old enough for YM, Teen People, etc. This magazine has advertisments, but not that many, and they're nothing inappropriate, just things like Smackers lip gloss or Secret deodorant.<br />I think this magazine is appropriate for the age group that it is targeted to. Girls' Life has articles about school, boys, seasonal articles about holidays, fashion, real-life, celebrities (though there isn't any gossip about who's doing what),  beauty, and other topics. I don't think you should read this magazine for it's beauty and fashion articles; try Teen Vogue or Teen People for fasion and beauty. Plus, there are quizzes, celebrity features and articles, embarrasing moments stories, advice to questions sent in by real girls, letters to the editor (of course!), and other fun features. You won't find any articles about sex and college, however.<br />My only problem with this magazine is obviously that the editors don't know what kind of girls to put on the cover and in their fashion and beauty pages. Usually, there are regular girls on the cover, sometimes a celebrity. But the thing is, Girls' Life usually doesn't put normal girls with glasses, freckels, dark hair or skin, or non-straight hair. Most of them feed us the picture of the ideal girl: tall, blonde-haird, blue-eyed, perfect complexion, no glasses, no freckels. That can ruin a girl's self-esteem, so I suggest reading this magazine not for it's models, but for the actual content. Besides from that one problem, Girls' Life would be an okay magazine for girls age 10-15.",1

You will get interesting articles on all the popular sports including swimming, basketball, baseball, tennis, football, and gymnastics, plus you will get great bios on some of today's hottest sports stars. My buddy Kim has a son who has a subscription to the magazine and he loves it. Not only is this a fun magazine to read, but it's interesting, informative, and a great collectible!!!",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1190073600,Making Your Living Space More Livable,"This Old House is a magazine dedicated to home improvement. Based on the popular PBS television program, this magazine aims to help its readers find new and better ways to improve the home and perform routine maintenance.<br /><br />Magazines and the internet are my primary sources when home repair reaches the critical point. This Old House is one of several magazines I like to read and it is the one I turn to most frequently when I need to find out about home maintenance. The majority of other home- related publications deal strictly with enhancements, remodeling, and general improvement. This Old House offers these types of articles, along with articles on general home repair, landscaping techniques, utility cost savings, and more.<br /><br />My favorite departments in This Old House are ""Around the House"", ""Toolbox"", and ""Salvage"". The last department, Salvage, sounds boring at first but it often gets very creative. This department selects a common household item- usually one that is probably slated to get tossed in the trash- and points out a creative way to re- use the item. Some of the ideas they come up with are surprising, making this one of the first sections I turn to when I get a new issue in the mail.<br /><br />Some parts of This Old House are not appealing at all, either because the suggestions are far too costly for someone like me; because they involve skills that I do not possess; or a combination of the two. The Luxury department is one such area. Another is the Design sections. These areas are intended for the more advanced home improver who has advanced skills at home design. There are some very expensive suggestions, too, and these parts of the magazine provide more fantasy reading than anything. However, there are still enough less expensive ideas to keep the magazine useful and practical.<br /><br />Overall, This Old House is a good magazine that offers some home improvement ideas, some repair suggestions, and some ways to enhance your home's value. The general repair advice is pretty handy and while I don't have much use for other parts of the magazine, I can agree that these are helpful to the right type of person. It makes This Old House a good publication for those who seek advice for home repair and home enhancement.",1

A309PFW8T6DMMZ,1356048000,"Love the content, hate the tiny font","I usually enjoy about three of the articles in this magazine, which makes it worth the price of the magazine to me. I find particular enjoyment in the house and organization articles.<br /><br />However, is it just me or is this magazine plainly hard to read on the subway? Its large size and heft make it a little bit of a drag on my shoulder to carry in my purse. Plus, its small font size makes me have to place my face a little too close for comfort to the page in order to read it. I wear contact lenses so I don't have ""bad eyes"". I think I have normal eyes, and yet, this font is uncomfortable to read because of its small font size.<br /><br />In summary, I enjoy this magazine a lot, but prefer House Beautiful for its easy-to-read font size and ease of carrying (not too heavy/bulky).

They suggest for instance, that you hard boil eggs, and keep them for a week in the refrigerator (page 18, November 2003 edition). True, a week is the limit for storing hard cooked eggs, and they will not kill you, but have you ever eaten an egg that has been sitting in the fridge for seven days ? It is enough to put one off the incredible edible forever. Five days is max folks, for a decent tasting egg.<br />The paper quality is quite good, with a matte finish, but if you want substance, and really inventive ideas, look elsewhere.",0

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,1420675200,Money magazine touches on various topics,"I understand that the money magazine cover is going to change within a week. However, I currently have the December 2014 issue of money magazine  titled annual outlook issue make more money in 2015; great ideas that will help you prosper in the year ahead p. 64. Additionally, unintentionally spotting the article in this issue titled look better than a local, starts on page 44 cheered me up. This is because I know that I have to eventually move  regardless of how my employment picture would look in both the current and the new area, however I prefer to avoid sharing the when even though Im already somewhat aware of the timeline-because I would need to confirm with my husband and give my employer at least a two to three week notice on top of my intuitive and logical awareness that it may happen sooner than I expect. There is also some insightful information on getting mental health treatment, and the best fast path to a degree that is on page 81. Money magazine also publishes retirement features. For instance, the November 2014 Money magazine issue features an issue titled Retirement Guide 2015. Coping with The High Cost of Caregiving (starts on page 18) and philanthropy 101 (starts on page 40) are some of the features covered in the November 2014 Money magazine.  As mentioned in a previous review, I would be fine with being employed until Im at least 85. The only reason why my husband and I are already planning to save enough money to comfortably retire by the late 2030s/early 2040s or earlier is because of our shared belief that social security in the U.S. will not pay enough for even a cheap apartment  by the time the late 2040s/early 2050s roll around. Additionally, we are both aware that were part of a generation where retirement accounts are our responsibility, self-employment may be a necessity not just an option, and also preparing for the possibility of age related discrimination still existing for both genders of all ethnicities/races (especially with me being a minority woman).",1

I like to keep informed financially and stay abreast of market trends. This magazine helps me do that. I also read Fortune magazine, which has a wealth of economic information and current information on various businesses. These two magazines complement one another, and I can recommend them both.<br /><br />If you have money invested in a 401K, IRA, stocks, or bonds, this magazine will provide you with helpful information to manage these in the current markets. Each issue covers a wide range of topics, such as careers, financial profiles of individuals, market information, home ownership, insurance, stock and bond recommendations - well, anything related to money.",1
A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292112000,Every Amateur Investor Should Subscribe; Information You Can Actually Use,"Bottom-line: ""Money Magazine"" is my new personal financial advisor and hopefully its sage advice will help me navigate the pitfalls of personal investing.<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit it my latest job move left us with a little more disposable income, and a pay raise last month helped immensely.  So we now have more money to invest, but I do not want to pay someone to do it for me, I want to keep my hands on my own stash thank you very much.  But I will admit I need practical advice on where to invest my money, not only for retirement, but for my 11-year-old's college education.<br /><br />I briefly though about subscribing to Fortune Magazine, but quickly dismissed the magazine: too upscale with little practical advice to the average middle class American.  I have long read the Money Magazine section on CNN.com, and found the information timely and utilitarian in the extreme.  So I decided to subscribe to the print edition.<br /><br />""Money Magazine,"" which bills itself as the magazine ""For you, your family, your future,"" is a monthly rag published by Time Warner Inc.  The magazine covers a broad swath of personal money matters from investing in education to sound retirement advice; from which stocks and bonds are the best long range pick, to the best places to live in America.<br /><br />Checking in at 156 pages (this issue), ""Money Magazine"" is refreshingly free of endless pages of wall-to-wall advertising, though every other page does tend to be an advertisement; I guess they have to pay the bills somehow.  But the advertisements contained within do not interfere with information presented in the magazine, nor do they compromise the quality.  From cover to cover, page-to-page ""Money Magazine"" has proven a very useful reference source on all matter concerning personal finance.<br /><br />Regular sections in the magazine include:<br /><br />o Features: feature length articles;<br />o Start: tips and helpful shorts on money management;<br />o Plan: planning for retirement, and other financial planning articles;<br />o Home: tips and articles dealing with the home;<br />o Invest: investment tips and stock, bonds, and mutual funds;<br />o Spend: smart ways to spend your money.<br /><br />The latest issue featured the magazines seminal ""America's Best Places to Live"" issue, in which the periodical lists the best place to bring up a family based on certain criterion, including Education, Jobs/Economy, Safety, Ease of Living, Arts/Leisure, and Park Space. I was pleasantly surprised to find two cities I used to live on the list.<br /><br />Other articles in this months (August 2006) magazine include<br /><br />o The Last 401(K) Guide You'll Ever Need; five rules that really matter.<br />o America's Best Places to Live<br />o Everything You Know About Kids and Money is Wrong; teaching kids about money doesn't work.  Here's what needs to be done.<br />o Hidden Assets; that dusty folder with the old savings bonds, forgotten gift certificates and yellowed insurance policies may hold some real treasures.<br />o Can Money Buy Happiness; research sheds light on how you can (and can't) spend your way to a sunnier outlook.<br />o Quest For The Simple Life; the Edels have raised frugal living to an art.  In our consumer culture, that's anything but simple.<br /><br />The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  The most useful part is the detailed advice on stock, bonds, and mutual funds picks.  There is never a hard sell; the information is presented in a well laid out and easy to read format.  For instance in the Invest section of this months magazine, ""Money Magazine"" laid out a listing of (70) blue-chip growth stock one could invest in the long haul.  For each stock the magazine listed the name of the stock, including ticker symbol, Price, 1-Month Return, 12-month Return, P/E Ratio, Earnings Growth, and Yield of the particular stock.  The same format is repeated for bonds and mutual funds throughout the magazine.<br /><br />But not all is sunshine and glossy pages.  Though I found the recent article on The Best Places to Live in America useful; it was short of a lot of pertinent information.  Cary, NC caught my wife's eye as a possible retirement spot, but the print article was short on detail.  On-line however, a lot more information was to be had including the median family income for the area, as well as median home price, and tax information.  The content on-line was much more involved; this is both a curse and a blessing; a curse for those who lack Internet access and a blessing for those who don't mind gleaming more information on-line.  I have Internet access and I would have preferred to get the information from the magazine' print edition, or both places.<br /><br />Other than that one decidedly minor quibble, I have no qualms recommending ""Money Magazine"" to anyone who asks.  The magazine is my new personal financial advisor and hopefully its sage advice will help me navigate the pitfalls of personal investing.",1
A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,1089331200,Best For Beginners,"I subscribe to several financial magazines, of which ""Money"" is one. I think that ""Money"" is an excellent publication for neophyte investors, as it does provide generally sound information and advice. It is very good at explaining terminology in plain English, which is to be applauded, but investors with more knowledge of investments and financial planning would probably be better off with another magazine, like ""Kiplinger's"", for instance.<br />""Money"" covers primarily investments in mutual funds, bonds, and stocks, although real estate and retirement planning are also dealt with regularly. I like the investment index feature in the back of the issue: it is honestly the only part of the magazine I routinely use anymore, although I do skim the articles, and read one or two per issue. My chief complaint with the magazine is how formulaic the articles are. It seems like every month there is an article called ""The Best Places To Put Your Money Now"", for instance. Timeliness is a good thing, but the magazine endorses long term investing (as do I) so the last thing I want to be doing is thinking about where to move my money to this month.<br />Beginning investors: this is an excellent magazine for you, and I say that without reservation. Overall though, ""Money"" is not bad, but if you are already fairly knowledgeable about financial management you can do much better.",1
AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,1233705600,The ideas are very pricey,First this magazine only comes 8 times a year.  Being that it is so infrequent you would think the publisher would have a chance to write more articles.  Instead this magazine is heavy on pictures light on articles.  The items that show are really nice and you instantly want to rush out and buy them until you see the price tag (several thousand for a chair) it is definitly a high end magazine.  You will need to easily earn 6 figures to buy the things you see in the magazine.  However for ideas this is priceless my wife and I are always getting ideas for our house from Traditional Home.  Be aware there are more adds than typical in Traditional Home.,1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1178150400,"Decorations, Entertainment, and More","Traditional Home is a nice little magazine about home living and the many ways to make a home look great, both inside and out. This magazine takes a slightly different approach to homes when compared to others of its genre. Instead of focusing on size and modern amenities, Traditional Home directs its attention toward classic style and elegance with an up- to- date twist.<br /><br />Home decorating/improvement are the main subjects in Traditional Home and there are several departments and main features dedicated to adding a touch of classic style to your house. One article might talk about the addition of different comforters and pillows to your bedroom. Another could talk about adding antique clocks to your family room. Still another might focus on sprucing up the outside of your home by planting flowering bushes. These features and departments all have the same goal in mind: To take a plain, drab room or exterior and spice it up with some old- fashioned elegance.<br /><br />Not all of the pages in Traditional Home are dedicated to the subject of decorating. The magazine does offer a few more subject areas to make it better rounded. It is common, for example, to find an article or two about home entertainment and this is especially true around the holiday season. There are also some articles that are related to travel; e.g., travel to visit a unique antique shop or partake in a home decorating event.<br /><br />Traditional Home is a classy magazine and there are many things I like about this publication. One nice quality is that the suggestions for decorating are not comprised of items exclusively for the rich and famous, like many other, similar magazines. Yes, there are some more expensive ideas presented here but there are an equal number of less expensive ideas for both decorating and for entertaining. Another quality I like is the personal touch so common in most of the articles. Ordinary people share their personal stories about why they chose to remodel their bathroom the way they did; why they celebrate Christmas the way they do; or why they added a collection of antique art to their family room. These personal touches help make the magazine more then just a buyer's guide- they make it a magazine that is nice to read and relate to.<br /><br />Overall, Traditional Home is a nice magazine about homes, decorating, and entertaining with plenty of colorful photos that offer great interior visual appeal. It is amazing what can be done to an ordinary room with some dedicated effort, and Traditional Home aims to guide readers in this direction;

A3BVRA2QL3TIOQ,1238371200,A Magazine Both Parents And Girls Will Approve,"Honestly, there are some ""girls"" magazines on the market so risque, I feel like I should be wearing a trench coat and sunglasses purchasing them discreetly in DENMARK instead of the USA. One of them (I won't mention the title, but I'm sure many parents will recognize just from my description) claims it is for girls ages 8 to 14, but you'd swear by looking at the cover articles it would be meant for Playgirl readers. A few examples direct from the magazine are: Five Fresh Ways To Get That Guy, What's your flirt style?, Get your Best body. And it seems (well, most of the time it actually is) that the magazine's main focus is about how to get a guy or look good for him.<br />Now, as for DISCOVERY GIRLS, Just-The-Opposite!!! Here is a magazine I'd gladly get for any girl as a gift. It's main focus is on friendships, but it covers an array of issues of interest to girls ages 8 and up.<br />It covers fashion (and their fashions are modest/down to earth fashions), celebrities, fun projects, and social issues. A few examples of past articles include: Spotlight on Volleyball, ditched by your friends, win free stuff.

Don't get me wrong, this magazine is cute for girls ages 12 and older but EIGHT???  The problem with our society is that kids are being pushed into growing up WAY too quickly while they are still too imature.  If your 8yr old is learning about how to talk to boys, what glitter to wear, how to maintain a BFF friendship - then what will they be reading at 13?  My bet is Cosmo.  Slow down everyone.  8yr old girls should be playing on a swingset, playing barbies, pretend school, etc...  If they are already bored of these things, my guess is that you pushed Barbies on your daughter when she was 3 which is your own fault.  Parents need to remember that the younger these girls turn into ""tweens"" the younger they will be teens and we all know what we did when we were teens.  Give your 8yr old magazines like ASK, MUSE etc...  Let them work their minds, not teach them to be shallow superficial girls.",0

Discovery Girls is nothing special and has as many advertisements as the typical teenage magazine. Plus, the topics covered in it are nothing really special, the fashion pages are lackluster, and the advice columns and such, well, SUCK. Topics in it are also sometimes inappropriate for the 8-12 age range, as well (some issues have stuff about make up, dating, and boyfriends and girlfriends. At EIGHT years old?!?)<br /><br />In addition to the high price, advertisements, and age-inappropriate articles, this magazine also is, well, boring. Nothing in it is really interesting and since it's so short, you'll probably read through it really fast (not counting ads).<br /><br />Save your money.

There are also some jokes, mazes and other brief entertaining items as well.<br />The magazine is a slick glossy around 32 pages and very nice. If you are looking for an upgrade from ""Highlights"", this would be it.",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1336262400,"National Geographic Kids: Too Much Fluff, too Little Education","Kids like to read magazines and books as long as they contain visual elements, games, and other things to keep them entertained. They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.<br /><br />My girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.<br /><br />National Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.<br /><br />National Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.<br /><br />Kids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal. Sum everything together and you have a magazine that isn't worth the money and should be avoided.",0

I also like the ratings of gadgets and explanations of ""what is it?"" as far as older or obscure kitchen items. The illustrations are clear and very helpful in teaching proper techniques like trussing poultry for example. Beginning cooks will appreciate the foolproof qualities and encyclopedic explanations of the recipes, and seasoned cooks will likely tweak tried and true recipes for even better results.<br /><br />I always know I can trust the recipes to come out right when working from my CI collection.

A2JJGIJI8X6KRS,1026777600,Wonderful Gift Idea for someone who loves Cooking!!!!!!!!!,"This Magazine is my #1 Favorite out of all 16 subscriptions that I had received within the past 4 years.<br />As the other reviews mentioned it goes into such detail that I often times carry it along as reading material for myself when I'm going out of town. I have bought this as gifts for at least 4 friends of mine in the last 2 years alone. I really enjoy the time the writers take in the Test Kitchen's explaining the ""why"" and the ""how"" the recipes work or doesn't for that matter. I find that this is one of those Magazine that is worth every penny no matter how much the cost. They review cookbooks and in their very own in depth fashion, go into detail in describing how they test the recipes in these cookbooks. And for someone like myself that buy at least 5 cookbooks per month this cuts down on the cost of buying books full of recipes that really aren't tested. I find it interesting when they ""test"" various products and appliances... I can't even begin to express what a value this subscription is all I can say is that every person I purchase this for has renewed their subscription on their own.<br />So what does that tell you huh?<br />BTW You can always purchase the Cookbook index that they put out at the end of every year it has every issue that came out.<br />Happy Reading",1

AEMZRE6QYVQBS,1155427200,a glossy take on wine for the amateur and the expert,"The Wine Spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you're rich or that you soon could be, all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine.<br /><br />There's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy, pleasing publication. But if you're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor. Just enjoy the game.<br /><br />That game includes a travelogue of the world's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself. This reader is in it for the long haul - I hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the Wine Spectator is my companion along the way.<br /><br />My job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like France, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and - of course - Northern California.  But with wineries now in 49 of the USA's fifty states, what's *not* a wine region these days?<br /><br />On those business treks, I find myself out for dinner as often as not. It's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a Pinotage in Capetown, since only South Africa produces this varietal, or to opt for one of Argentina's persuasive Malbecs because they're just *that* good.  We're not talking wine snobbery here, just satisfaction at the margins of life's all too margin-less journeys.<br /><br />If this sounds like your game, the Wine Spectator may be a worthwhile investment. Even if not, consider splitting a subscription with a colleague. That's what I do. At half the price, I get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy, beautiful, pleasant magazine. Life can deal you worse.",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1135123200,"Wine Reviews, News, and More","Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products, wine facts and education, and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year, so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.<br /><br />Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine, and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings, so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80, you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis, there is often contact information, such as the name of the winery or web page, so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.<br /><br />To help shoppers find the wines in each issue, Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition, because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.<br /><br />Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings, and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues, but it could get annoying to some readers.<br /><br />In spite of these few annoyances, Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good, very convincing, and very persuasive. They really know wine, and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.",1

The columns are informative and on-topic. All in all, probably the only wine magazine that I will continue to get on a regular basis.",1

Now, it's an ill fitting mix of new and old writers trying to be fresh and hip while being spoon fed by the car manufactures. The magazine lacks consistency, focus and any sort of clear vision as to what they're about.<br /><br />C&D mostly seems to print what the biggest manufactures want them to. There have been several articles lately, such as on the new Nissan GT-R and Corvette ZR1, that literally mirror articles in other magazines even featuring some of the same quotes from the same car execs.

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292371200,The Car Magazine for the Everyman,"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.<br /><br />Like most men in their twenties I was a car guy.  I ate and drank the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, and colored sheet metal.  I could recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  I subscribed to and devoured all of the (four) the nation's most popular car magazines of the time: ""Car & Driver,"" Motor Trend, Road & Track, and the beauty queen of them all, Automobile Magazine.  But as time and overseas assignments took my attention elsewhere, one-by-one my subscriptions lapsed and my car fetish all but died.<br /><br />But, now in the autumn of my life, I have rekindled my love of cars, especially expensive high performance mid-sized cars from well-known and well respected nameplates we all know: Cadillac, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Lincoln, Jaguar, and of course Mercedes-Benz.  So when I got a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail, I plowed through the 230 or so men's magazines before finally deciding on ""Car & Driver Magazine"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.<br /><br />Like most car magazines, ""Car & Driver"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine offers so much more.  Unlike the other automobile periodicals, ""Car & Driver"" serves up truly useful (practical) information for the everyman, or woman.  This subtle distinction elevates ""Car & Driver"" above the rest and makes it far and away the best car rag for my hard earned money.<br /><br />However, like other three American car magazines ""Car & Driver"" covers a broad swath of the American automobile scene, but it also does a fair job of delving into the international automobile scene as well.  And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Aveo's of this world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Car & Driver"" magazine.  And the magazine does this is a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.<br /><br />For instance in the October 2008 issue ""Car & Driver"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Acura ZDX, Alfa 8C Spider, 2011 BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, 2010 Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 Convertible, 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP, plus a comprehensive write-up on The Best Cars for $20,000.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive comparison article: Audi R8 V-10 vs. Ferrari 430 Scuderia, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine this side of the pond.<br /><br />Another strong incentive to read ""Car & Driver"" is its decided lack of wall-to-wall advertisements.  Most of the magazine is dedicated to substance; the articles are what make ""Car & Driver"" such a joy to read.  The articles are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  And although the writers fill the paragraphs with lexicon of the automobile industry, the prose never talks down to the reader, or looses my interest along the way.<br /><br />Another way ""Car & Driver"" distinguishes itself from the rest, is its more than comprehensive write-up on each automobile within the magazine.  Even the shortest articles, or write-up's feature a detailed description of the car, its interior and exterior specifications, road test results, pricing, and possible competitors.  No other magazine that I have read thus far--Automobile, Motor Trend, or Road & Track--offers as much useful information.<br /><br />Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up a 6-page article on a WWII era Jeep!  Not exactly need to know information, but human interest stories are always welcome in this world seemingly filled with nothing by death and mayhem.<br /><br />Even some of the photographs in ""Car & Driver Magazine"" have a story to tell in the guise of in-depth exterior and mechanical analysis.  In the final analysis there is no other car magazine I would rather subscribe to than ""Car & Driver Magazine.""  Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.  For me there is no other Car Mag!",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1225238400,Can't Curb Your Enthusiasm? Read Cycle World!,"Motorcycle enthusiasts are a unique breed and the main quality that sets them apart from the rest of civilization is their unyielding enthusiasm for their chosen sport/hobby. They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity.<br /><br />Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication.<br /><br />I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me.<br /><br />Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible.",1

I liked the look and content of this magazine and subscribed for three years twice. In a month my subscripiton will come to an end and I doubt I will renew. The quality and quanitity of the magazine has dropped quickly over the last few months. The pages have noticeably been fewer and more advertisements seem to fill most of the pages now.  It just isn' the same magazine that I paid for nearly three years before. As with other magazines of late, I have noticed a disturbing and unsatifactory trend: the quality is going downhill and the magazine has lost about 20 pages. There seems to be a trend out there, sadly, not just with this magazine, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable when you handle the issue. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a certain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazines are shrinking the issues without any notice what so over to the subscriber. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I just don't know. I have noticed that Amazon price beats the price directly offered by the magazine itself and I don't get that. Hopefully, nat Geo Traveler will go back to where it was, though I doubt it, if people are willing to contiually pay the same $$ for less pages, why should they? For this reason, this is another magazine I will not renew. You'd think the publishers would want to keep the subscribers they do have, but they don't. I know because I have contacted editors of a few magazines: Smart Computing for one and the editor first asked me what I missed. When I told him, he couldn't care less. What a bad attitude! Needless to say, I cancelled my three year subscription and received a refund, only partial because they wanted to keep all my money. How do you like that? All I can say is think carefully now before you subscribe to any magazine. I know I am.",1

After subscribing to National Geographic, I was disappointed with the quality of National Geographic Traveler.<br /><br />The locations, and vacations reviews in this magazine are expensive and out of budget to all but the wealthiest.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 8 issues annually<br />- Expensive travel recommendations",1
AEMZRE6QYVQBS,1166918400,has big feet,"Like a puppy with large paws, ESPN The Magazine may grow up to be a large periodical. Right now I'd call it a fun-loving puppy without housetraining.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, puppies are cute. I like puppies. Everybody does.<br /><br />You may not want to pay an annual subscription for a magazine that looks and acts like a puppy, though.  That's your call. I wanted SI, but that venerable publication can't be had for the price of frequent flyer miles like ESPN The Magazine can. So I compromised.<br /><br />By comparison with SI, ESPN The Magazine gives you a flashier, big-photo, post-modern jumble of short pieces that seems to derive from the verbal, television-friendly style of its parent. I'm not the deepest of sports fan, so I don't mind this. But if you're after the kind of in-depth analysis that SI offers, you might be disappointed by this alternative.<br /><br />ESPN The Magazine is definitely a *fun* read, and if that's what you want, you'll like this. When my first issue came wrapped in a 'special promotional issue cover jacket' that presented Ricky Bobby as 'Sports Figure of the Year?', I knew instantly that this publication couldn't be all bad.<br /><br />And it's not.<br /><br />But it's light.

Most of the content in each issues can be written by a couple of interns, but within each issue are one or two lengthy article that maybe worth reading. Otherwise, this magazine is great to read in the bathroom, or during breakfast. I subscribed ESPN magazine because I wanted a cheap magazine that provided an overview into sports.

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292371200,The Car Magazine for the Racing Circuit Guy,"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.<br /><br />Like a lot of middle-aged men I am a car guy.  I eat and drink--more or less--the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, painted wheels, ergonomic cockpits, and colored sheet metal.  I can recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  At various times in the last five years I have subscribed to and devoured three of the nation's most popular car magazines: Motor Trend, Automobile, and Car & Driver.  But, I recently gave up my subscription to Automobile and received a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail; I replaced it with ""Road & Track Magazine,"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.<br /><br />Like most car magazines, ""Road & Track Magazine"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine has little to distinguish itself from its brethren.  I used to read ""Road & Track Magazine"" back in my twenties, and while the magazine has moved itself smartly into the 21st century, the basic formula that made the magazine fun and informative back in the 1980's remains virtually unchanged.<br /><br />""Road & Track Magazine"" does an excellent job of covering the national (American) and International car scene. And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Volt's, Suzuki Swift's and Toyota Corolla's of the world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Road & Track Magazine.""  And the magazine does this is in a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.<br /><br />For instance in the June 2010 issue ""Road & Track Magazine"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Jaguar XJ, Audi R8 Spyder; Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 vs. Nissan GTR vs. Porsche 911 Turbo; plus a long-term test wrap-up of the Acura TL SH-AWD, as well as a features write-up on the Suzuki Swift, Mazda Demio, and Toyota iQ.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive competition articles: Electric Boogaloo -Tesla vs. Lotus, and Formula 1, Then & Now, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine in the country.<br /><br />Because of its name ""Road & Track Magazine"" does seem to cover the racing circuit more than it fellows, which would be fine if I followed Formula 1, NASCAR, and notable figures from that world, but I don't so I tend to skip over those articles.<br /><br />Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up an excellent 2-page article on the past, present and future of the spark plug!  Not exactly need to know information, but for anyone with a keen interest in the internal combustion engine--like me--this article hit the spot.<br /><br />When the final page is turned is ""Road & Track Magazine"" different enough from the other two car periodicals I read to renew my subscription?  In a word: no.  While I certainly enjoy reading the magazines various articles and columns there just isn't enough between the glossy covers to justify renewing the subscription.  I'm just not into the auto racing scene and ""Road & Track Magazine"" is big into Formula 1, NASCAR and other racing related themes.<br /><br />For raw, general automotive new ""Road & Track Magazine"" is not as good as Motor Trend, Automobile, or Car & Driver.  But with a subscription cost of only $9.97 (or less, over at Magazines.com) per year, you can afford to grab 12 issues and make up your own mind.",1
A1PGC1GEBY9CZU,1456099200,"More and More Ads, Less and Less ""Reader's Digest""","This review is on the Reader's Digest magazine and not the Amazon subscription or subscription process.<br /><br />Reader's Digest is probably known to every American who is old enough to think for themselves.  It has gone from a fairly decent magazine which would actually truncate stories to ""fit"" the reading public.  They had plenty of their own bits and pieces including, my favorite, Humor in Uniform, Life in These United States and Laughter is the Best Medicine.  Over the years things change.  First it's less stories and more ""fluff"".  Then it's less stories and fluff and more advertising.  Then it more advertising on top of more advertising.  It's as if print magazines have a death wish.  Yes, we know, it costs to print a magazine.  We also know magazines SHOULD make a reasonable profit.  It's when the profit and bottom line becomes the focal point that problems arise.<br /><br />I will still read Reader's Digest.  I will no longer subscribe to them.  That went out the window some time ago.  The stories keep me coming back.  The excessive advertising keeps me from staying.",1

AVF9FV7AMRP5C,1252627200,"Time is a decent weekly, you get what you pay for","Time magazine does a good job providing a general summary of news events each week. I feel that many reviewers have unrealistic expectations for this magazine. At the time I am writing this review, Amazon is charging $20 for a yearly subscription to Time, which amounts to less than forty cents per issue. At this low price, I do not expect high quality journalism but a magazine that does a basic job at covering general news.<br /><br />For those seeking quality journalism, I recommend the economist, and the new yorker. By charging subscribers more, the economist has been able to afford to maintain and enhance the quality of its magazine. Keep in mind that a subscription to the economist is six times more than a subscription to Time magazine. At the time, I am writing this the magazine industry is experience record drops in advertising revenue, Time just announced layoffs. In light of all this, this magazine is doing its best to maintains its quality.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Cheap<br />- Provides a general overview<br />- Has no annoying magazine inserts (my pet peeve)<br />Cons<br />- Lacks depth<br />- Moderate amount of advertising",1

I do wish they would place less celebrities on magazine covers and more models again, but it is nice to see your favorite singer or actress on a magazine, esp Gwen Stefani who is always gorgeous. The magazine does tend to lean more towards the left in terms of politics but thats fine with me, if that isn't your preference maybe another magazine would be better suited for you. That aside, I'd say that out of all the high fashion magazines Elle would rank right next to Harper's Bazaar but behind Vogue.",1

A1L7R2764ED46Y,1346889600,FULL OF ADS,"To begin with, I am not much into fashion, so take that into consideration while reading my review. I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines. I enjoy a range of health magazines, home and family magazines, and girly magazines that aren't quite so fashion centered. Again, this is my opinion so please don't criticize me. I understand location has a lot to do with how you view fashion and body image but I am perfectly happy with me!<br /><br />Update: I'm glad some people are finding my review helpful! I also forgot to mention that my mom (a woman in her 50's) exchanges magazines with me and this magazine has very small print which made the magazine hard for her to read. And I flipped through the last issue I received and most of the articles (at the end of the magazine since the first half of it is full of ads) were about feminism. I am not a feminist and that's as far as I'll go on that subject. You can formulate your own opinion of the articles. Just pointing it out to potential subscribers since I had no idea what to expect from this magazine. Another article in this magazine was defending photo shop and feeding false body images to women as artwork like it is no big deal! I was shocked because it contributes to eating disorders and low self esteem in many women, especially young women. A better name for this magazine would be SUPERFICIAL.",0

Nice variety here in articles of different lengths, with timely *and* interesting subjects like Tina Fey.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed artsy/fashion section.<br /><br />When I get a new magazine in the mail, I usually flip through and fold down pages I'd like to go back to.

The only plus side to the magazine is that it features bargain prices on clothing every once in a while. The pairings of clothing they put together used to be great, very wearable for the daytime and for most people not in a fashion business.

The result: one page you are reading about ten best eyelash curlers, next page you are pondering the tragic fate of a female South American assassin. A radiculous combination...<br /><br />Not so with In-Style. The magazine does not make pretentions about its purpose: to educate women on what to wear NOW, how to wear it and where to buy it. There is ample advice on best beauty and hair products. The articles are always fashion/entertainment industry related, nothing too heavy duty (for that I go on CNN.com and BBC.co.uk), and convey lots of useful information. To give you an example: with winter approaching, I know I must invest in a new coat and some other warmer garb. I want to make every penny count. In the September issue I was glad to discover the article: What to Know Before You Shop. I did learn some new tips and tricks! The multitude of pictures is also inspiring: I realized with only a couple of new accessories and a new way of combining items I already own, I could create at least three brand new and fashion forward outfits! Yey for me! ;o) I am also happy to report that the magazine promotes a wide range of price points: yes, there are some ""dream"" items, like the [...]+ necklace, but they are balanced by items below the [...] mark and everything in-between.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this magazine helps you as much as it helps me!

Mental Floss is a great magazine that you can sit down with and read in one sitting.  It even occasionaly brings a smile to your face.  I suggest you give it a chance but don't expect to much.,1
A2AV7Q95QGPTO0,1179360000,"Intellectually stimulating, yet readable","I came across this magazine in a college bookstore, and bought a copy to browse through with dinner. Free-spirited, yet dealing with topics of interest to intelligent people, it is a real find. I immediately entered three subscriptions, one for myself, one for a relative and a third for a friend. Isn't that the greatest recommendation?",1
A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,1088899200,The Best Thing In My Mailbox!,"I have subscribed to ""Mental Floss"" from the very beginning, and now look forward to each new issue anxiously. Founded just a couple of years ago by two former college roommates who wanted a fun, hip, urbane magazine to make them smarter with style, ""Mental Floss"" has become a huge success, and is one of the few new magazines that debut each year that is actually prospering.<br />Each issue is loaded with information on interesting topics, from how common (or very uncommon) things work, to odd and unknown histories and biographies that you will not find anywhere else (and if you did, certainly not in as condensed and succinct a form as you will find here.) Without exception, the writers are literate, knowledgeable, and good humored.<br />The things that you don't know will amaze you after reading this magazine. Try ""Mental Floss"", and I am willing to bet that you will be hooked. I know I am.",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1081123200,Informative Info on Social and Physical Sciences,"Scientific American is a good magazine for those who enjoy reading about modern science, advancement in technology and medicine, economic improvements, and anything else of a scientific nature. Each issue is about 130 pages in length and can be counted on to stimulate your intellectual curiosity.<br />One thing that makes Scientific American more appealing than other science magazines is the fact that it includes articles on more than just the physical sciences, like physics, chemistry, geology, etc. It also contains timely and informative articles on social sciences, like economics and politics. This adds a lot to the magazine's appeal, and it's one of the main reasons why I choose to read it each month.<br />One thing that might bother some potential readers of this magazine is that Scientific American does tend to present a mostly pro- government angle on the social and human interest stories that it presents. In almost every instance, the writers of Scientific American draw the immediate conclusion that only the government can possibly solve the pressing issues of the day. They don't even give much consideration to anything else. They immediately concede most any problem to the authority of the state.<br />In spite of the ""liberal"" leanings, however, I feel that Scientific American is still a very good publication to read. It includes puzzles that test your knowledge of science, book reviews on recent scientific book releases, and some good, well- written articles about science and how it relates to our day- to- day life. It's a good magazine for those who like to stay informed.",1

You won't find the easy-breezy style of Time Magazine as it covers, for example, the gas between stars, how females choose their mates (take notes on that one!), how cells communicate, or voice recognition software. SA gets into the meat of it. However, consider this is ultimately not a peer reviewed journal for scientists. Where it lacks in meat, it compromises in accessibility.

A37EGLKQ6T6DWF,1399248000,Not objective,"I like most scientific publications because it comes down to, or should come down to, objective reporting of facts. Unfortunately SA has gone and started to editorialize the information it reports. I'm amazed at the community of ""scientists""  who swear up and down the sky is falling,or at least that it has a hole in and we're all going to die because of it. Do these people take into consideration the absolute immensity of the earth and atmosphere? They can tell that us, unequivocally, that we are damaging the atmosphere and that apparently they know the correct climate conditions for earth in 2014. What a load of dreck! The earth is so massive that man amounts to a pimple on it. The atmosphere is so immense that earth is a speck of dust, they can't possibly know what the correct ratio of gasses and vapor is supposed to be, yet we are bombarded with junk science that says we are killing the planet and the atmosphere because we release gas and vapor. How about proof of concept? Hewal and stream, river or ocean. They can't but they want us to believe that they can heal the earth and atmosphere? If we can't find a pinging airliner in the Indian Ocean, how can we believe that these ""Chicken Little"" scientists and their gloom and doom forecasts? We can't control or influence the weather or the atmosphere around the globe, If everybody in China jumped up and down at the same time, could they influence the orbit of the earth? No! because it's so huge. it can't be done. Yet we hear daily that we have to sequester carbon and stop using petroleum and switch to solar, wind or unicorn power. Guess what happens to sequestered carbon in trees when the tree dies or is cut down. It gets released. Al Gore set  the alternative energy industry free with his forecast or ""Global Warming"".  We've spent billions of alternative energy (Solara) and objective people have figured out that we can't meet demands by converting to ""sustainable"" energy sources. We have been sold a bill of goods, pay no attention to the man or woman behind the curtain, The political theater of ""greenies"" are going to save the world using regulations and unfunded mandates. SA has drunk the Kool-Aid and are now mixing up and distributing batch after batch each month. Who believes that man can ""fix"" the weather or environment? Who believes that somebody can correctly predict the correct climate and weather conditions for earth in 2014?  Count me out, I'm subscribing to and actual objective journal that reports actual or real information not this unicorn riding, mantra chanting mass hallucination of a Big Bank Theory magazine.",0

A1RPTVW5VEOSI,1355961600,Sad decline of a once great journal,"Scientific American was once the premier scientific journal for the educated reader with an interest in science. Every article was written by a researcher in that field, and nothing was dumbed down. Every October, SciAm published a special issue that covered just one topic in depth, and these special issues presented the state of the art in that area in a way that was readable and understandable to the non-specialist, but at the same time could have served as a text for the student in that area. Some of those special issues were re-published as book, and when I was a grad student, the special issue on The Brain was actually used as a text for one of my seminars.<br /><br />Today's SciAm is a sad, pale, echo of that once great journal. Most of the pieces are short, superficial, one or two page essays that can be quickly skimmed over. Much of the content deals with policy issues, not the underlying science. And whereas mathematics is the common language of science, the tool that (as a friend once remarked) keeps scientists honest, there's not a whisper of it in today's SciAm- a particularly sad thing given that one of the most popular features in the old SciAm was Martin Gardner's column on recreational mathematics! Gone also is the Amateur Scientist, a section in which serious amateurs would present their research programs, complete with detailed drawings of apparatus. It was here I first read about experimental rocketry, constructing computers (in the 1960s!) and building telescopes.<br /><br />When I was a student in middle school, forty years ago, I found much of the math daunting, but that only spurred me on to study more and learn the tools that would unlock the knowledge found in the articles. Today, it's a magazine that  requires nothing of the reader. Facts are presented in a superficial way as absolute truths, and the magazine is designed to be skimmed over, and discarded. A sad end to a once great journal.",0
A1IU9VPCBKZPE8,1322697600,An Excellent Science Magazine,"I currently subscribe to three science magazines - Scientific American, Discover, and Science Illustrated. Of the three, I like Scientific American the best, but I must say that I enjoy all three.<br /><br />Scientific American seems to have more of the lengthier feature articles that go into more depth on a particular subject. For instance, in the latest issue I am currently reading (Dec. 2011) there are nine feature articles covering a diverse array of subjects such as: technology, space exploration, biology, climate change, neuroscience, animal behavior, forensics, and education. I always find a number of articles that I am interested in reading in every issue.<br /><br />Some articles I found very interesting in recent past issues are:<br /><br />* Hidden Switches in the Mind - a fascinating article on epigenetics.<br />* Waiting for the Higgs - an article about the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs.<br />* The First Americans - who were these people and how did they get here.<br />* A Formula for Economic Calamity - an interesting article on Wall Street's betting our future on flimsy science.<br /><br />There are also many departments covering various subject matter. In this issue, I count twelve departments. Some departments I find interesting are Advances, The Science of Health, Skeptic, and Recommended. These cover short special interest topics.<br /><br />As a science aficionado, I can certainly recommend this magazine for those of you interested in the sciences.",1

Published 6 times a year, it has exquisite photography, and brilliantly colored, thick glossy pages. The layout is coordinated so well with the ads (which are thankfully unscented), that I sometimes confuse them with the articles, and the topics range from art, antiques, and travel, but the bulk of the publicatation is devoted to elegant homes and gardens.<br />Among the many articles in The July-August 2003 issue for instance, there is ""Masterworks: The Late Seascapes of Turner"", with some little known works by this great English artist; ""Coral, Beyond the Reef"", fabulous jewelry from the coastal region of Naples, Italy, and floral designs from Bella Flora in Dallas, where celebrities buy their gorgeous bouquets. There are no prices listed for any items in this magazine, because I imagine that if one has to ask, one can't afford it.<br />Five homes are featured, all different, all in their own way marvelous, from an old Atlanta mansion filled with curious antiques, to a bright and modern, sparsely furnished London home with pistachio walls and lots of light.<br />As Editor-in Chief Lisa Newson says in ""The View from Veranda"", ""Color is magic"", and this magazine serves up a lot of it...a feast for the eyes, and a glimpse of lavish living.",1

A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,1302220800,VERANDA Virtuosity!,"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.<br /><br />You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.<br /><br />VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace. (As an aside: I love buying my shelter magazines through Amazon as I've been able to get great subscription prices and track my subscriptions so I don't miss a single issue, which is helpful when you subscribe to lots of magazines.)<br /><br />Under new editor Dara Caponigro's vision, VERANDA magazine sings and soars.",1

The end of the year issue making predictions for the following year is very broad and interesting. The anonymously written articles are annoying. Why hide your opinions?<br />The magazine promotes lessening or eliminating corporate taxes and not raising tax rates on the rich, while promoting government-paid: training programs based on what local employers want, cash assistance for employees who move over two hours from a new job, intensive home visits with health and nutrition care for children younger than preschool, expanded preschool, and earned income credits contingent on work so as to discourage poor people from not having paid employment (instead of taking care of their own young children).  Who's supposed to pay for these programs?  The declining middle class?<br />Their promotion of unhealthy homosexual ""marriages"" and applause at the ""gentle"" decline of worldwide fertility rates from 6 children per woman in 1960 to about 2 children per woman indicates their population control agenda and distorted sexual viewpoint. Don't they understand that a population dominated by old people indicates a dying civilization?<br />I learn some facts and get some opinions here that I don't elsewhere, but their editorial slant is a self-serving promotion of the failed Washington consensus.",0

One son said he wished I would read it so we could discuss it.  Anytime your offspring want to talk to you, that's an incentive.<br /><br />I am impressed with the organization of this magazine. It opens with The world this week and Leaders and Briefing. It is then organized by geography: United States, The Americas, Asia, China, Middle East and Africa, Europe, Britain and International with a special section on Brazil in this issue.  Then it covers topics: Business, Finance and economics, Schools brief, Science and technology, Books and arts and Economic and financial indicators.<br /><br />I like the global perspective this magazine offers with the U.S. just being one player.  Articles are deep and comprehensive with information that isn't easily available elsewhere in mainstream publications.  This week the cover article is on the extraordinary comeback of al-Qaeda and how it holds sway over more territory and is recruiting more fighters than any time in its 25 year history.  In Iraq since we left prematurely, the magazine indicates, over 1000 civilians a month are being murdered by al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda wants to bring Iraq, Syria and Lebanon together into a single caliphate.  Those are just some of the interesting facts in this magazine. While reading it, I felt I was immersed in a high-level course in international politics and economics.<br /><br />If you read this magazine every week, in a short time you would be up to date and literate on global issues and economics.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book review of the new book on Salinger in this issue.<br /><br />If you read every article thoroughly, it would take several hours.

AMVC9WTXYKNJ1,1328572800,Well worth the investment in time and money,"Yes.<br /><br />It is expensive.  No matter how you get it.  The best deal regularly offered is through the website.  If you're affiliated with an academic institution, you can get it for around seventy-seven dollars for a whole year.  This, as far as I understand, is for all levels and both sides of the dais.  I don't know how strict they are on checking up on that, but as far as I've seen, it is only offered through the website.<br /><br />It is worth it.  They identify as a center-right 'newspaper' in England.  This makes it somewhat of a center-left paper in the States.  My own politics are further to the left than the editorial voice of The Economist, but for my money there is no better weekly news magazine.  I grew up stealing my father's Time and Newsweek magazines.  I liked them, but have over time shifted towards focusing on popular culture and towards a dumbed down-audience.  Perhaps my own expectations grew to be more curious about the world than what the actors on 'Friends' thought about their success.<br /><br />The Economist meets those expectations.  They cover the world, in depth.  They're still something of an establishment voice, so if you want to reinforce your left or right radical leanings, you need to seek another publication to supplement your views.  I for one, keep the Monthly Review.  I tried to do it all in one publication, but I dropped the Nation because it was over-focused on the American Left, and I felt silo-ed.<br /><br />The depth is the selling point.  There are several sections covering Africa, Latin America, the U. S., Britain, general economic news, science, and the arts.  Each of these sections contain several articles, with a section-closing editorial from the Economist's editorial teams.<br /><br />The depth is the biggest drawback though.

Ten and a half dollars a month for people that have gotten used to the downloading and consumption of content for no charge.<br /><br />Still, the Economist is the 'newspaper' with the widest reach in the world and the Kindle subscription beings it right to you at the speed of light.  Sure, there is a lack of pictures and the charts can be hard to read with the gray-scale, but the advantage is awesome.  You have it right away and the news is fresh and sent to your dedicated reader device (or other Kindle software).<br /><br />One issue is seven bucks off the newsstand.  The price is comparable to a non-student subscription.  And it is fresh and I don't have to read it off of a back-lit screen.<br /><br />My biggest problem is digesting all of the content within the span of one week while reading and working and all the other things I do.  I wholly recommend this if you can accept a nominal price for first-rate journalism.",1
AVF9FV7AMRP5C,1256515200,One of the greatest magazines out there,"The economist is one of the best magazines available today. The economist has been able to improve the quality of the magazine by charging subscribers more in order to cover the costs of sending journalists out to research, and report.<br /><br />I read the magazine from cover to cover, and find the articles interesting, well researched, and backed up with extensive analysis and data. It took me a while to get adjusted to The Economist. This magazine includes comprehensive coverage into the economic and political events that impact this world. The economist features extensive coverage into events in Europe.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Quality journalism<br />- Interesting Articles<br />- Data/Analytics<br />- Global Viewpoint<br /><br />Cons<br />- Expensive<br />- Look elsewhere if you needs tips about stocks<br />- Coverage focuses on Europe",1

And if you have no interest in economics whatsoever, you may still find it essential.<br /><br />The Economist's coverage of politics and current events is top-notch. It contains news dispatches and analysis written by on-the-ground journalists located all over the world. There is a careful mix of playful artwork and punning headlines with serious, thoughtful writing. Other highlights include excellent science articles and brief book reviews.<br /><br />Content is also posted online as it comes in; print subscribers gain unlimited access to The Economist's website. (A cheaper online-only subscription is also available.) As a bonus, subscribers can now download an unabridged audio version of each issue: About 7 hours, pleasantly narrated and skillfully produced, with a separate MP3 for each article.

While I am now in an older demographic that its numbers are huge, it is pretty much ignored now.<br />Surely I am not the only fifty year old in good shape, or who is interested in being and staying that way. Maybe a mens and women's health plus.<br />Anyway you get used to that sort of thing. One reviewer said all you need is one year of this magazine and it will cover everything. That could be true sort of, but I like it for the ideas, motivation, and it has some really cool food stuff, and recipes.<br />I get mens health, and I got womens health for my significant other.

A2H3JURQZOHVMB,1403740800,Various Health Matters,"Please understand that I am only sharing my journey towards fulfilling some of my personal fitness goals and this review is only a symbol representing and acknowledging that I still have so much to learn. As per a recent confirmation phone call,I humbly admit that this current  (June 2014) magazine issue was gifted to me from a company affiliated with Capital Media as a free promotional issue. I was actually trying to figure out what fitness magazine to help me along with my goals (especially due to helping me continue my progress since losing 25 pounds after starting my current job in October 2013). I actually prayed for the best magazine to assist me in my goals and strangely enough this magazine was sent to me for free shortly afterwards.  I have in front of me the June 2014 issue which has Miranda Lambert on the front cover. On pages 55-59, she bravely shares what she went through in her weight loss journey and is compassionate for others who have more weight to lose. From my modest perspective, Miranda Lamberts interview for this issue of Womens Health is very candid and inspirational. Pages 60-62 cover some of Miranda Lamberts physical fitness techniques  (as given to her by her trainer Bill Crutchfield). Page 124 shows an interview with Seth Meyers while pages 126-127 is a juicy article written to explain why many women are secretly bad girls.

""Oh, but I was one of their first subscribers!""...yeah, who cares?  After I really gave it some thought, I sure didn't care.  The fact that 6 of the last 8 issues were still wrapped in their plastic wrap further confirmed my lack of interest in this magazine.<br /><br />I used to always snatch my boyfriend's copy of Men's Health when it would arrive in the mail and devour it before he got home from class.  So when Women's Health invited me to try out their first issue, I jumped at the chance.  I was happy that the magazines were very similar, but after awhile it seemed too repetitive.  Then Men's Health itself started changing into something boring and bland and my boyfriend chose to end his subscription.  Now, it seems like the same pattern is emerging with Women's Health.  It went strong for awhile, but now it just feels like they're regurgitating the same information over and over.<br /><br />It's not so much that Women's Health is a *bad* magazine.  It is informative, it does have decent columns and helpful information.  But it's nothing special.  It doesn't contain any information that I can't find in other (cheaper) places.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because I do think it's a decent magazine to subscribe to for 2-3 years, but not necessarily worth a long-term commitment since you'll likely begin to feel a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu after a time.<br /><br />Needless to say, my subscription is up for renewal and I'm opting out.",1

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1153699200,Enticing Photos and Great Articles,"Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area.<br /><br />Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine.<br /><br />Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers.<br /><br />Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families.<br /><br />The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the ""Currents"" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price.<br /><br />Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel.<br /><br />Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans.<br /><br />Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more ""unknown"" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property.",1

A1JXRXYVSUAW6I,1279756800,Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine,"I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.<br /><br />Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes, this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.<br /><br />During a cross country moving event 7 years ago, I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology, not a telemarketer for sure, called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests, you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",1

A2B1UZREZPO2EJ,1412985600,No Longer For The Ordinary Person,"After 4 years I finally called it quits with the Every Day magazine. The magazine has changed in size, layout, and target audience to the point where I feel I am NOT that demographic. The magazine has become aimed at the more wealthy members of society. The recipes are a bit repetitious or made with ""one shot"" ingredients, i.e. expensive ingredients that are hard to find. Ingredients used once then you are stuck with something you will never use again.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed to see Rachael Ray go off on tangents about her expensive vacations. It's disheartening to see her monthly product page filled with items like jeans that cost $150. I thoroughly enjoyed the start of the magazine, but I do feel ostracized by recipes I cannot afford to make or that include ingredients so unique that making the recipe costs a lot of money. Sorry, Rachael.  My budget has no room for you now. I love recipes, but yours have become too far off course.",0

So all her lovely desserts and high-carb treats are off limits now. So I MAY be bitter. Just a bit.<br />That being said, nothing really sets this mag apart from the other ""foodies"", other than maybe some cachet for her name. It's dessert-heavy (as are most) and too too many recipes call for something I don't keep on hand and wouldn't buy anyway. Artichoke hearts? Lemon grass? Fresh chard? REALLY?<br />Healthy and fun eating doesn't require fresh mango Vidalia chutney or seared Alaskan You've-Never-Heard-Of. If you love using unusual ingredients, making aoli, trying the newest thing, and have access to these ingredients, snap this up. There are tons of recipes and ideas in each issue, and the tone is very loose and friendly. Me, I'd rather have a down-to-earth well-seasoned grilled chicken breast with veggies.",1

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so I am always on the lookout for good recipes that I can prepare and eat without messing up my diet.  I had heard good things about the Everyday with Rachael Ray magazine, so when I found this great price I decided to try it.  I loved the general setup of the magazine, but was disappointed that the recipes didn't show any nutritional information.  How am I supposed to know if the dishes are diabetic-diet friendly, if there is no nutritional information available?  I already received a renewal bill, but I won't be renewing the magazine unless I see some improvement in the next couple of months.",0
ANEDXRFDZDL18,1279238400,Letting my subscription lapse...,"I've subscribed to this magazine for several years, and I admire Rachels' perkiness and I do enjoy some of the articles. The problem I have is none of the recipes really appeal to me. Either they are strange, example: ""Elvis Styled Grilled Banana Sundaes"" or just not appealing  ""Salami, White Bean and Water Cress Crostini."" She focuses a lot on pasta dishes, dishes with tomato, appetizers which are fine, but not tempting, and I don't find they have as much family appeal.  The non-holiday months are fairly generic, although I admit I do like the Fall and December issues.<br /><br />There are also articles that focus on clothing, travel and the psychology of shopping.<br />I would suggest buying a few issues and seeing if her style and tastes are yours.",0

A1RE4GU6S5ZF52,1184544000,Really well put together,I first saw this magazine at my dentist's office and couldn't put it down.  This is definitely not Martha Stuart style.  Rather it is a practical magazine that gives you great ideas for cooking and other aspects of your life.  I was really impressed with the week of recipes they plan for you and the SHOPPING LISTS!! They prepare for you so that you don't have to do any extra thinking.  I think this magazine can really help to organize your time better so that you want to cook more.,1

A281NPSIMI1C2R,1150502400,Artistic Design with Unique Features,"Spa Parties and T-shirts that say ""Delish"" are very much a part of Rachael's magazine complete with pullout recipe cards and travel features. The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.<br /><br />The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes.<br /><br />Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.<br /><br />What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.<br /><br />This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The ""Ask Rachael"" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).<br /><br />What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? ""What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?"" I'm always intrigued.<br /><br />If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

A2O6SU5YDVSDN4,1450915200,"Fun for fantasy farmers, interesting articles and pretty pics. No substance for the practitioners here.","This was sort of a test; many reviewers have said it's VERY hobby, with little in-depth info. I grew up on a dairy, milked through college to pay for tuition and food, and managed a dairy for several years. Now DH and I own 38 forested acres, with a horse, goats, and garden, and I am interested in other farming ventures. So I decided to give this a try.<br /><br />Yes, it treats topics in a very surface way, and is probably best suited for the armchair farmer, rather than the one with callouses. The article on dairy udders was interesting, but it was a salad, not a steak. No meat. Had I written it, even with years away from milking, it would have filled a lot more pages. Kudos, BTW, on finding a Holstein with a shapely udder. Those were few and far between in my milking years.<br /><br />It's entertaining but just not enough substance. I have been considering growing mushrooms, so I was excited to see the Fungi Fruit article. Well, 2.5 pages later, all I really learned is that the pricey portabellas are just regular button mushrooms from a second or third flush. Lots of pretty pictures, but I was looking for information. Sadly lacking.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like to read brief interesting articles and look at pretty pictures because you are dreaming a happy fantasy of farm life, you'll like this magazine. If you are already out before dawn in the sleet feeding, planting, or milking, you are waaay past this.",1

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292284800,This Magazine Must Keep the Paparazzi (All of Them) Employed,"Bottom-line: While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.<br /><br />The New Year brought a new commitment to fitness; Yeah!  But no, this time I'm serious about want to shed a few pounds and lighten the load on my poor knees.  Of course this mean a copious amount of time on the treadmill shedding those unwanted pound, listening to Christina Aguilera and reading ""US Weekly Magazine,"" which my gym seems to have an over abundance of to the exclusion of any other periodical.<br /><br />I am not usually given to reading entertainment magazines; I would hate to think of myself as a celebrity hound, but ""US Weekly"" is short on words and long on pictures and advertising; in other words just right for the treadmill machine where my attention is not ripe for reading.  Unlike Entertainment Weekly, or even People, ""US Weekly"" does not pretend to be serious, the magazine does not attempt to cloth itself in the veneer of serious journalism.  ""US Weekly"", which is published, well weekly, is little more than a thin picture book full of the minutiae of celebrity life.<br /><br />There are no articles in ""US Weekly"", at least not anything that would pass as an article in say Entertainment Weekly, or People; there are instead picture captions and the occasion short write-up (a paragraph or two) on this star or that, or those stars over there.  ""US Weekly"" is just a tad more reputable than say The National Enquirer or Star Magazine, but just barely.  For example, the February 19, 2007 issues' cover featured a colorful full page picture of Reese Witherspoon beside a headline that read Hollywood's Revenge Diets! Better after breakup!  How newly single stars get slim and sexy fast.  Meanwhile a sidebar featured Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson under a title which read Plastic Surgery!  Jennifer was a ""Winner!"" while poor Jessica was ""Scary!"" after her sojourn under the knife.<br /><br />Regular sections in the magazine include:<br /><br />o Hot Hollywood<br />o Hot Pics<br />o Features<br />o News<br />o Style<br />o In Every Issue<br /><br />But lack of depth does not prevent the mainstream advertisers from calling; indeed there is an advertisement--mostly courting a female audience--almost every other page.  This is not out of line with other magazines in this genre, although ""US Weekly"" is the only magazine I know of that does not have a masthead.  Based on the advertising and editorial content this is a magazine designed and published for young women.  And that is not to imply that young women are shallow and unfocused on self; I make the statement because there are a lot of (female) style and fashion photos contained therein, along with a fair amount of make-up advertisements.  This is not normally (straight) ""guy"" territory.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.  And while I have to admit that (women) celebrities intrigue me, I would rather not read a whole magazine devoted to their every step; ""US Weekly"" is not for me.",1
AOR590VF8YI5J,1097107200,"Entertaining, but..........","US Weekly is a mix of a tabloid and a fashion magazine, though it is a bit better at telling the truth than some other magazines *ahem*. It's one of those magazines that will come into great use when you're bored and want something interesting yet light to read, and if you're celebrity obsessed, you'll definitely LOVE this one. My main problem with it is that everytime I pick up an issue, I feel like I'm stalking these celebs. In their August 30 issue, they had a two-page spread showing Jessica Simpson shopping at a grocery store, loading them into her car, and even pulling her dress back up. I don't know about you, but I felt as though that was completely unnescesary. The magazine is big on these things, like showing Britney Spears eating lunch and Paris and Nikki Hilton walking on the beach. It gets very annoying sometimes. However, some of the stuff they talk about is interesting, and I enjoy the fashion and beauty sections. But if you're one of those who can't live without the latest celebrity gossip and news, this would be a great magazine for you.",1
AXFI7TAWD6H6X,1064361600,A guilty pleasure of mine,"I am not really big on celebrity magazines that are really tabloids but with glossy pages like People magazine but I must admit to having a soft spot for US Weekly. Yeah it is pure fluff and nothing to be taken remotely seriously however I get my kicks out of some of the articles that are published there. My biggest beef with the rag is that in the latest issue of US Weekly, it only gives a paragraph each to the passings of Johnny Cash and John Ritter who had passed away two weeks ago while they do an entire bloody article on Bennifer Afflopez, the most overexposed and overrated celebrity couple on this entire planet. I found that quite distasteful. Even that tabloid People Magazine gave a couple of pages to both celebrities. What is just as gross is seeing really unattractive celebs in their bathing suits (i.e Avril Lavigne and her guitar player). However I do love the best & worst dressed pages in the back. I love the snide remarks from the weekly guests. I don't care who is the best dressed, it is who is wearing the ugliest outfits that I care. Another celebrity couple I could live without seeing in the pages of US Weekly for the rest of my life...Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. Oh lordy. The two most boring celebrities known to mankind. And their acting isn't anything to write home about either. If anything, US Weekly makes for good reading material in the bathroom, otherwise it ain't serious journalism that's for sure.",1
A26KYDJOAGI05S,1056412800,Trendy Tabloid,"Us weekly is mostly about what the stars are wearing and the latest trend on television.  There are some tabloid style photos which are completely tasteless, and I'm not really sure who cares if Brittany Spears had a latte at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf on 4th street last Wednesday, but mostly it's a fair gossip magazine.  The articles are all really short and definitely without much depth, but most people aren't looking for that when they read Us weekly.  The fashion police is pretty funny; it's just a bunch of comments about star's clothes from a group of people with no real authority on the subject.  Most are comedians or writers, which is probably why it's so funny.  This magazine is definitely a quick read, and I don't feel any smarter when I'm done reading it, but it does keep me up to date on the Hollywood side of pop culture.",1

The initial delivery was as estimated and its reliable each month. I check out monthly specials for magazines in our home. I also renew when the magazine goes on special again. It just adds to the length of subscription. Also subscription are easy to managed right here on amazon. I've changed addresses a couple of times since the magazines have started.

Now it seems to be directed at the late teen and twentysomething readership.  The beauty and fashion tips attempt to mirror Vogue and Marie Claire, but the editors lose sight of the fact that teen and twentysomething age groups rarely have that kind of disposable income, and neither do most of the forty-somethings who remember growing up with Cosmo in the 70s and 80s.<br /><br />The featured articles are still good, though, and the beauty and fashion are worth a look.",1

I read an article online that a woman is trying to get news stands to sell this magazine in a plastic bag so that young women cannot read it's contents at the store! I do not enjoy reading this magazine. I only tried it because I knew it was so popular among women and wanted to see why. I also was not happy with the customer service. My magazine took forever to come in the mail and I just decided to cancel it because of the delay in shipping and the content is smut! I can spend my $15 on a much better magazine.<br /><br />One more thing: If you have allergies, BEWARE! I had to pull out at least 5 or more perfume inserts and the magazine still smelt like perfume!

Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to re-subscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hot-off-the-press fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, ""how to manipulate your man"" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue:<br /><br />""She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34"" (she's for it and it's in the Need to Know section of the magazine...)<br />""Secrets His Sex Style Reveals""<br />""Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves""<br />""Get Hit On All The Time""<br />""Orgasm Whisperer""<br />""First Time Sex Bloopers""<br />""Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game""<br /><br />I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It's rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men... Sad...<br /><br />If you are looking for magazines with fashion/beauty focus, I recommend: In Style, Style Watch, and Lucky.<br /><br />Regarding Cosmo subscription service: I received the Sept issue promptly, FOLLOWED by the August issue (they were clearing out their warehouse, I guess...).",0

Most of the family stuff doesn't apply either.<br /><br />I do enjoy the crafts sometimes, and the recipes sometimes offer a gem. The budget dinners are interesting, but I can usually beat their pasta and soup per-dinner prices while serving burgers or roast.<br /><br />To be honest I subscribed on a whim at $5 a year, and it's worth that, but not much more.

I remember the times when I looked forward to reading it, when I spent 30-60 minutes on an issue, when the valuable information (I am a movie buff, and I don't watch TV or listen to pop music) was at least 50%, when I chose the DVDs in my Netflix movie queue based on their EW score. These guys used to be that good. Not anymore.<br /><br />Nowadays it's just another piece of pop garbage.

ABS2A1OWX5Q8,1423180800,The Entertainment Bible.,"The weekly bible of everything entertainment, from movies, TV, music , video games and books (among other things). I have been s subscriber for nearly 15 years and although I do not agree with many of their reviews, there is always something interesting to read in the magazine. The only thing that irks me a lot is their opinion that THE WALKING DEAD is the best TV show on the air since the invention of sliced bread. Any intellectual viewer will see that the characters come directly out of Stereotypes 101 and the plots are nothing but recycled George Romero and countless other zombie films, but they always manage to put a story or photo of the series in every issue. Whomever thought that this was the best show ever on TV really needs to watch more TV. Even the worst episode of THE X-FILES makes the best episode of THE WALKING DEAD look like the worst episode of WHO'S THE BOSS. Just because a TV show has taboo-breaking gore on it does not make it a great series. What about M*A*S*H, THE WIRE, THE SOPRANOS, ST. ELSEWHERE, OZ, JUSTIFIED, THE AMERICANS, GAME OF THRONES, AMERICAN HORROR STORY or any other good show that made or makes TV worthwhile? To EW, they are nothing but chickenfeed when put next to THE WALKING DEAD. Like I said, that is really my only complaint about the magazine, but it is enough of an annoyance whenever I see I cover on the zine devoted to the show (and there have been many!). They do have a good staff of writers and make me laugh every now and then, so I give them a pass when it comes to TWD. It's a great zine at a very affordable price if you have it renewed every year.

It's a sort of a good mix of pop culture *plus* a teeny, tiny bit of gossip, but the *""interesting"" kind, meaning- you won't find out about Snooki's latest drama, but you will get the scoop on how a much anticipated Hollywood franchise might be headed for trouble.<br /><br />The best thing about EW is their coverage of upcoming movies, books, television, music, and stage, plus interesting articles on the business of entertainment- everything from in depth coverage of TV shows to an inside look at a much anticipated film to long interviews with directors, etc.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the magazine is that it's starting to get very web and tablet focused- meaning, the content of the magazine is slowly getting leaner and leaner, and on every other page there's a reminder to check the EW website or iPad edition for the rest of the features. I'm not happy about this- I really like it when they had about six or eight pages of movie reviews. I'm not happy that now it's four pages of movie reviews, and two of those pages are tiny ""one sentence"" reviews and charts. It's the same for books and television and other media, as well.<br /><br />Regardless, I still eagerly dive into every issue that pops into my mailbox, and out of all the magazines I start and drop subscriptions to, this is the only one I really consider ""necessary"".

A3GA09FYFKL4EY,1473379200,NOT Ok!,"The best thing I can say about this magazine is that I didn't have to pay for the subscription; I bought it with air miles. Good thing, too, because this magazine is NOT worth its price, either off-the-rack or via subscription.  Want to keep up with your favorite celebrities? The ""news"" in this magazine is nothing more than a collection of rumors.  Want fashion advice? The most you'll get here are photos of celebs wearing something and what it is.  Most of the fashions and cosmetics are, of course, waaayyy out of the price range of the average reader.<br /><br />The stories are rumors you can get much cheaper via supermarket tabloids, or ""quotes"" from a ""source"" that's supposedly ""close"" to the celebrity, or paragraphs of what the person ""might"" do, based on trends or what their celeb pals have done in the past.  Usually these are incorrect.  A few months ago I the magazine gushed about Princess Kate's pregnancy with twins, and how Buckingham Palace ""should confirm"" it soon.  Today the cover squeals that Kate and her sister Pippa are both pregnant, Kate with a girl and Pippa with a boy.  I won't hold my breath over it.<br /><br />Subscribe to US or PEOPLE if you want intelligently-written articles about celebs and others in the news.  The magazines don't source stories on gossip and rumor, and are written by reliable reporters instead of paparazzi, which I suspect is the case here.  OK! was anything but, and I'm sorry I wasted air miles on it.",0

Yes, I know it doesn't pack the news punch of Time or Newsweek, but it has a nice variety of articles ranging from current events to features of everyday heroes.

It's turned into LOTS and LOTS of reality TV coverage of non-actors, along with very young new actors and musicians, with very limited coverage of established actors.  It seems to me they cover a smaller range of people than they used to.  I'm telling myself that I""m not going to renew my subscription, but I'm still reading every issue, just skipping the articles about people from shows I would never watch.  Their reviews of books and movies are perhaps worth the price of the magazine, and aren't available on their website.<br /><br />If you're interested in reality TV and very young actors and pop musicians, you'll love this mag.",1

""People Magazine"" is not meant to teach you anything.<br /><br />Kick back, pull out your monthly train pass, set down your bags and flip through a few pages.

Over all, this article is a quick-read - you can get through the entire magazine in one sitting in about half an hour.

You're on Dialysis"" was much better, though covering the topic of those unfortunate enough to require kidney dialysis. Every year, over 100,000 Americans start, and 25% die within 12 months, a fatality rate the writer report as one of the worst in the developed world - despite spending about $77,000/patient, believed to be more than any other nation. Meanwhile, our government has kept secret clinic-specific data that could help patients make better decisions (Medicare agreed to release them after this article), and the two corporate chains dominating the system (DaVita, Fresnius) together earn about $2 billion in operating profits/year. More than 80% are for-profit.<br /><br />The author reviewed inspection reports for more than 1,500 clinics out of 5,000 from 2002-09, finding reports of filthy or unsafe conditions in almost half the units checked. Sixty clinics had at least five citations for prescription errors. Consequences are seldom meaningful - just 16 clinics were closed from 2000 to 2008.<br /><br />Italy spends about one-third less than the U.S., and only about 11% die each year, vs. 20% in the U.S. Patients have more than 5X as much contact with their physicians as in the U.S. Patients start dialysis sooner than in the U.S.<br /><br />The 'good news' is that Medicare is now moving to improve dialysis care.<br /><br />""Your Child Left Behind"" reports on a study by Hanushek that compares individual American states with foreign countries, looking at 15-year-old students ranked as the best at math in each location. Only 6% of U.S. students perform at the advanced-proficiency level in math, lagging some 30 other nations, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Finland, Switzerland, Belgium, and Netherlands, in that order. OECD nations trailing us included only Portugal, Greece, Turkey, and Mexico. Massachusetts ranks as the best state, behind 16 other nations. Even restricting U.S. students to whites or those with at least one college-educated parent put New York below Poland's all children, and Illinois' pupils with at least one college-educated parent performed lower than all students in Iceland, France, Estonia, and Sweden.<br /><br />On a per student basis, we spend more than all but Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Norway.",1
AVF9FV7AMRP5C,1253750400,The slow decline of a great magazine,"I started reading The Atlantic in 2004. Back then The Atlantic provided insightful and interesting articles covering Iraq and Afghanistan, and occasionally included some fiction.<br /><br />In the last five years, I have witnessed a slight decline in the quality of this magazine. No doubt this is due to the decline in advertising revenues of this magazine. The Atlantic has scaled down and axed the fiction section from its monthly publication. Fiction is now published annually. Recent covers have included tacky and cheesy headlines designed to capture attention and are more appropriate for a tabloid than The Atlantic. Examples have included<br /><br />- The Britney Show<br />- The Passion of Alec Baldwin<br />- If Kim Jong Il Used Facebook<br /><br />Despite it's recent shortcomings, I would recommend the Atlantic to anyone interested in reading about global affairs, finance, culture, and politics.",1
A70NFM6KHU24F,1236902400,Not quite the print edition,"First off, let me say that The Atlantic is one of the finest, most intelligent and original magazines on American politics. It's essential reading and an absolute bargain for the money. As complementary readings, I'd suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Yorker/dp/B00005N7T5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Yorker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wilson-Quarterly/dp/B00005NIP3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wilson Quarterly</a>.<br /><br />The pros of the Kindle version over the paper version are that you get instant delivery of each new issue, it costs half as much per issue (and you pay per issue rather than annually), and it's more environmentally friendly, given that you've already bought a Kindle. The cons are that you miss out on some excellent graphics. Also, though the Kindle version is well-organized, the linear progression of one article after another, uninterrupted, inevitably grows tiresome. After subscribing to the Kindle version for about a year, I've decided that it's not quite worth it. I'm switching to the print edition. Of course, the same content is also available on the magazine's website at no cost, but the paper version is much easier on the eyes.",1
A3FVAWZNKW9GX,1229472000,Excellent Dentist Office Addition,"I like the Atlantic, but I confess I do not like it enough so that I will continue to subscribe. I read it while awaiting treatment at my dentist's office, while on the train or at a coffee shop. In 45 minutes, I have had my fill. It is otherwise not compelling in its originality or capacity.<br /><br />The articles are better than most popular magazines. I enjoy Mark Steyn and Mark Bowden, but get tired of Christopher Hitchens' proselytory writing tone.<br /><br />Occasional issues have been dumbed down, are feel as if they are being geared for the Entertainment Tonight crowd.<br /><br />The Atlantic is a good read in short spurts, but inconsistent over the entire issue, I now only buy a couple issues a year, at most.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />[...]",1
A3JPFWKS83R49V,1214352000,Intellectually Stimulating and Highly Anticipated Each Month,"The Atlantic is an intellectual magazine and one that I have been reading on and off for many years. This magazine is best known for its political/current events/social articles that tackle some tough issues of the day and it delivers most effectively when it's offering some commentary on world events and social issues and these are the articles I turn to first when I read The Atlantic. I like the political articles best, but there are plenty of other non- political yet very thoughtful articles in each issue.<br />Most every article in The Atlantic is thoughtful and well- written. Look closely at the authors of some of the stories in this magazine and you will notice some high- profile names on more than one occasion. Christopher Hitchens, Mark Bowden, Eric Schlosser, and others are known to contribute an article or two in each issue of The Atlantic. These writers, and others like them, are ready to offer their take on some of the critical issues of the day.<br /><br />The Atlantic certainly offers some interesting, thoughtful, intellectual articles and one fact that sets them apart from those found in most other magazines is that the featured articles are often very long- sometimes exceeding ten pages in length. Most magazines shy away from articles this long because they know that most reader's have an attention span that is far too short to finish the entire piece of reading in one sitting. But The Atlantic is different. If the subject matter is such that an article needs to be ten- plus pages in order to thoroughly cover everything, then The Atlantic is quick to oblige. I appreciate the excellent coverage but I must admit that some articles are almost too long. Even when I have an interest in the subject matter, I often end up stopping halfway through because I cannot hold my attention any longer.<br /><br />Another section I like in The Atlantic is the book reviews section. To present a fair and balanced perspective, The Atlantic reviews new books from many different genres and I like that there are different reviews of varying lengths. One section of The Atlantic called Cover to Cover includes short summaries of many different books. These are nice when you don't have time to read a lengthy review of a book and just want the basics. But there are also some very long book reviews in The Atlantic, along with some advertisements for new books that include a short, 50 to 100 word summary of the book. I like reading the reviews, but I like this section best for its exposure to new book releases. It is like looking at a quick rundown of intellectual books and I have, in fact, discovered some very good titles from this part of the magazine.<br /><br />Overall, The Atlantic ranks among my favorite magazines and I look forward to some serious, intellectual reading in each issue. I admit that some articles are a tad too lengthy, but I still like The Atlantic for its intellectual stimulation and for its focus on current events. It's a very good magazine for cerebral types who like to read about politics and social issues.",1

Every month they have a ""whats hot"" section that gives trend information, and a truth in decoration section that highlights ONE piece of furniture like lamps, ottoman, shelves and goes deep on the subject. Surprisingly I have also cut out a few recipes from this magazine as well-a little foodie surprise.<br />This is a great gift for women under 30 living on their own and wanting to dress their nest, clothing design friends, friends that like inspiration and decor, people that office at home, and people who have more that one home.

The reason why I did not renew my subscription as the magazine seemed to lose its homey feel after the Reiman Magazines were sold to another publisher.

Subsequently, I learned that this magazine caters to people as far north as Maryland. West Virginia is included too. In other words, this magazine caters to an audience that is wider than I first thought, which I think is a good thing.<br /><br />I also like the current editor a lot - I think he does a good job of balancing the need to keep the magazine relevant / current with the desire to tie the new issues into the larger Southern Living legacy. He lets the magazine celebrate tradition without being overly stuffy or being overly resistant to change and/or modern tastes. In other words, the magazine keeps its unique voice but also stays fresh/current too.<br /><br />One additional comment is that Southern Living always has lovely covers.

A281NPSIMI1C2R,1486598400,Roasted Banana Bars with Browned Butter Pecan Frosting,"I found a Cooking Light magazine from 2009 and tried their banana bars with browned butter pecan frosting. Can I say delicious (the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first), but I think personally I'd about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try. I'll try other recipes in this magazine if I find any in the future but I'll remember to pay attention to the sugar.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K,1333238400,"Shallow and Maxim-esque, Esquire is bloated with ads","The cover on my last issue featured Sofia Vergara in Agent Provocateur's black lingerie - and I still didn't bother to renew my subscription. It was too little, too late for a magazine that initially drew my interest as I smarter alternative to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maxim/dp/B002IYSZBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maxim</a>&nbsp;and a more coffee-table friendly alternative to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playboy/dp/B001UJICAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playboy</a>. Alas, after a one-year subscription, Esquire failed to capture me.<br /><br />I purchased my Esquire subscription with the same expectations I had for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GQ/dp/B00005N7QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GQ</a>, magazines known more for their abundant advertisements and cologne samples than for an unique, interesting take on men's interests. Esquire pushes well beyond my limits. The April 2012 edition (my last) makes a perfect example. The table of contents appears on page 25; advertisements packed between it and the cover:<br /><br />Bvlgari<br />Giorgio Armani<br />Ermenegildo Zegna<br />Dolce & Gabbana<br />Calvin Klein<br />Woodford Reserve<br />Lincs DC & Co<br />Newport Beach Film Festival<br />Hugo Boss<br />Luminox<br />Moontower Comedy & Oddity Fest<br />Buick<br /><br />That's 24 pages of advertisements before you reach the first editorial copy. And if you think that's an unfair representation, let me share that the next 20 pages includes ads for JC Penny, Tommy Hilfiger, Triumph, Canali, Salvatore Ferragamo, Ford, Breitling, Hickey Freeman, Gucci and Citibank. Within the next 20 pages, there are two more pages thinly spread with a table of contents, a staff listing, and only four pages of content, one of which carries the staff listing jump.<br /><br />So, in the first 45 pages of Esquire, there are less than four pages of actual content.<br /><br />Only one article, ""Miracle"" by Craig Davidson, was of the quality that I'd come to expect from Esquire. The nine-page piece (two pages serve as bloated title art) explores the medical advancements of synthetic hormones to delay age-related conditions.<br /><br />The Sofia Vergara cover garners two thumbs up from me. However, only three more pictures of her appear in the magazine. Three! That's reason enough to fire an editor, maybe a couple. I can only take so many pictures of shaggy, bearded, brooding men hawking shoes, watches and cologne. If you are going to put Sofia Vergara on the cover, at least have the decency to treat your readers to a longer layout, at least a half dozen pages.<br /><br />What's left is a choppy, increasingly juvenile collection of short articles and humor that illustrates how much Maxim and the other Laddies infected the entire men's magazine industry. The April 2012 edition included these one-page, puddle skippers:<br /><br />Levi's made and crafted<br />Mad Men's fifth season<br />New books by Stephen King and John Grisham<br />How picky are sperm banks?<br />Keyboard shortcuts we need<br /><br />In summary, Esquire is at the 1977 Elvis stage of life. I look back on the old issues with the same fondness I once held for Men's Health, Playboy and GQ. For a magazine approaching its 80th anniversary, Esquire needs some of those synthetic hormones to ward off its bloated visage and marked decline in quality features. Someone forgot being entertaining and smart are not mutually exclusive. Simply, today's Esquire is shallow and Maxim-esque.<br /><br />Rating: Two stars.",0

A3QMJMTLJC34QC,1292112000,The Intellectual Man's Magazine of Choice?,"Bottom-Line: When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine;"" who knows the magazine just might make me a better man!<br /><br />The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Esquire"" magazine stands out as a periodical with substance, style and intellect, but at the same time is not afraid to feature a beautiful woman on the cover and within it glossy folds.<br /><br />""Esquire Magazine,"" whose tag line is Man at His Best, was founded in 1933 and is published monthly by the venerable Hearst Corporation.  The magazine has a long history of featuring noted authors of their day, including Malcolm Muggeridge, William F. Buckley, and Truman Capote among other notables.<br /><br />However, ""Esquire Magazine"" is known and has been known as much for its artsy cover designs as its high-brow content and had given birth to a few notable art designer careers.  To this date the cover of ""Esquire,"" remains a work of art with big bold colors, and larger than life personas framed by flowing text.  The covers alone rival another venerable men's magazine--Playboy--in style and sex appeal.  The only difference is that ""Esquire"" gives equal deference to men on its covers, though they--thankfully--are not shown in various stages of undress.<br /><br />""Esquire Magazine""--a monthly publication, is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information, from its (mostly) useless monthly column The Guide to Sex to the interesting 10 Things You Don't Know about Women, written by a different female celeb, which I find somewhat useful.  The first third of the magazine is devoted to these little nuggets of information designed to help craft a better man.<br /><br />In addition to the monthly Features section, Esquire also includes a rather lengthy and engaged celebrity interview; this month it is Angelina Jolie, two months ago it was the delectable Halle Barry.  Some might find these sort of celeb-driven interview trite, given the massive print and video coverage already afforded far too many so-call celebrities, but there is something to be learned from the oft-candid gab-fests with the stars.<br /><br />But, ""Esquire Magazine"" because it is a men's magazine, does pay homage to barely dressed, well crafted (meaning air-brushed) women within it covers, just not so many as, say Maxim or Stuff, but they are well represented.  And ""Esquire Magazine"" in not above objectifying women as its yearly Sexist Woman Alive anointment clearly shows.  The reigning queen Scarlett Johansson is set to give up her crown soon to a new winner, so the magazine has started drooping clues as to who the next winner will be; it is up to us to figure out who before the moniker is bestowed upon another blonde-haired, blue eyed American beauty; women of color need not apply it seems.<br /><br />However, If the two latter magazines take the stance that the way to a man's mind it through his eyeballs and groin, ""Esquire Magazine"" appeals to a higher sensibility hinting that men might just learn a thing or two from the fairer sex, thus elevating the intellectual discourse between the genders.<br /><br />And great writing is still at the forefront of the magazines agenda.  If the first third of the rag is dedicated to the snippet, the later half is devoted to lengthy articles, with little or no commercial interruption (YES!).  Excerpts from novels written by both males and females find a home within ""Esquire Magazine"".  And authors, both known and unknown grace the pages.<br /><br />But there are investigative articles as well, which I less compelling but, but welcome nonetheless.  A recent article featured a man who is now in charge of security at a major nuclear power plant in the U.S. who used to work for Blackwater as a paid gun for hire.  The article portrays the man as something more than a macho ape with a gun for hire; he is given a decidedly human face and heart, which I found oddly engaging.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine"".  When I first picked one up years ago I was convinced that there was nothing for me within its (somewhat) high brow pages, but I have come to enjoy the magazines style and substance, though I must admit that most of the advertising is not designed for someone of my limited financial station; yes I make a good living, but little of my current income is disposable enough to by a $500.00 wrist watch even if I wore them, which I don't.<br /><br />But if you are banned (for whatever reason) from reading the quintessential male magazine, Playboy, ""Esquire Magazine"" comes in close second, followed by GQ.  If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, Esquire Magazine might be for you.  Now that I have started my subscription ($10.00 for a year from Magazines.com), I doubt I will let it lapse, it is turning out to be just that good.

I was so glad when Amazon finally brought this mag to us on our Kindle Fires...they were always sold out in my small town and now I can always have it delivered to me each month on my Fire.  It is full of different types of teas, cakes, tells you of all the tea shops in my area.  It has wonderful articles as well as recipes for tea cakes, scones, etc.  If you enjoy your tea and tea parties with your child or grandchildren or just want to sit back with a cup of tea and enjoy a nice read,then you will love this magazine.",1

A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,1249430400,Style Watch + Lucky + InStyle = my style Rx...,"Though creative, I lack natural ability and patience to painlessly put together my outfits. Therefore, I rely on three magazines to keep ""frumpy"" at arm's length: People Style Watch, Lucky, and InStyle. What these three magazines have in common is their visual approach to fashion: you will not find there silly articles on global affairs written by teenage interns. Instead, you will be treated to lots of pictures of fashionable style setters not only on the red carpet, but, MOST IMPORTANTLY, in street clothing. I believe these to be much more meaningful to an average Earthling such as myself then the overstilized artsy fashion photos one finds in the likes of VOGUE...<br /><br />I also like the fact that the magazine identifies the brands. I may not be able to afford everything, but on many occasions I have been able to make prudent additions to my wardrobe based on the editors' recommendations, and/or acquire more affordable article based on the ""original"".<br /><br />Fours stars only, as I would like to see more fashions specifically for the 30's/40's set.",1

A3NWN21HH5CEWZ,1198886400,my new favorite magazine!,"I highly recommend this magazine for working or stay at home moms. There is truly a little bit of everything.  Inexpensive fashion, makeup tips, healthcare, nutrition, fitness, relationships, family, etc... It doesn't prefer one to the other and there are useful tips jotted all over the place that are truly useful. There are very few ads in the magazine and the ones they do have usually come with useful coupons.  It seems to market young moms ages 25-40.  I am 31 and when this magazine comes in the mail, I honestly read it front to back.  No useless stories or expensive fashion that is out of my reach.  I just hope it stays as consistent and true to the market they are reaching.  Thanks All You!!!<br /><br />7/29/08 UPDATE:  I just reordered this for another 2 years.  This magazine is still great and I actually start thinking about when another issue will be hitting my mailbox which hasn't happened since I was a teen.<br /><br />Top 10 Favorite Parts:<br />1. Sudoku, Futoshiki, Crossword and Picture Puzzles in every issue<br />2. Table of Contents shows a picture of the front cover with page numbers for each tag - quick to flip to what interests you.<br />3. Easy layout to read. There are ordered sections called You Self, Your Health, Your World, Your Home, Seasonal, and In Every Issue.<br />4. Normal everyday people - no stick figure models in the this mag.<br />5. Fashion, decorating and make-up suggestions are all normal brands at normal stores (Target, Macy's, Gap, Walmart, Old Navy, LLBean, Pier 1)<br />6. Little fluff and most of the ads that are in there have coupons<br />7. Safe enough to leave on the table around kids (no kinky stuff)<br />8. Just enough family and kid-fun info but majority appeals to women so you don't feel so mommyish readying it<br />9. No gossip or celebrity picture.  I don't buy anything that pays scummy paparazzi.<br />10.  I can read it from beginning to end the first day and still go back to the issue multiple times thru the month for decorating, fashion and recipe ideas.  Great value<br /><br />I normally don't write long reviews but this is truly a great magazine!<br /><br />EDIT:  7/7/09 - BEFORE you order this magazine PLEASE look over the time it takes to get your first one in the mail.  Amazon states it takes 6 to 10 weeks from the day you purchase right at the top of the page.  All the 1 star reviews are from idiots who are mad their magazine hasn't come yet and ""it's been a whole month!""  Stop leaving poor reviews because it isn't All You's fault or Amazon's - it is your own fault for not reading the obvious print on how long it takes to arrive.  Be patient.  It is a great magazine and doesn't deserve the bad 1 star reviews for people's lack of common sense.<br /><br />EDIT: 7/5/13 - I still order and read this magazine every single month.  I think the content has stayed the same but I think there are a few less coupons than before.  The only place you can pick this magazine up in the stands is at Walmart.  And yes, it still takes a long time to get this magazine like every other magazine from Amazon.  You can get it a few weeks quicker going directly to their publishing department but I like the magazine subscription reminder thru Amazon as opposed to getting paper mail from publishers.  Earth friendly and easier to remember.",1

Such as:  use a sunscreen when you drive/ try this one: and then it lists a specific brand of sunscreen without saying why it was so good, etc.  Almost like they were really promoting specific brands without the reason behind that.

A3R7MXVQRGGIQ9,1439942400,An interesting and informative magazine for anyone who lives in the Midwest part of the country.,"My wife and I are voracious readers.  We read the papers every day, as well as books and magazines.  This magazine (Midwest Living) focuses on living in the Midwest but has articles and features that may be of interest to anyone no matter where you live in the U.S.  I just finished reading the June/July 2015 issue which had some interesting and informative articles and departments.  The following is just an example of the material in this magazine:<br />Notes of the North was about the beautiful music, art, and wilderness of the Apostle Islands in Bayfield, Wisconsin. Flower power showed some of the floral fabrics, wall papers and accessories that brighten up a home. Viva Mexican night gives 14 delicious recipes you can spice up your dinner time.  They also have shorter articles on travel, the Midwest life, discoveries, events worth writing for and reflections.  Even though this is a magazine that appeals to women more then men, it often has articles and features men might enjoy reading as well.  It is also reasonably priced at about $2.00 an issue when you subscribe.<br /><br />If you live in the Midwest you might want to check out this magazine.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J.

AMVC9WTXYKNJ1,1297468800,"A Better Value, but with some issues","You have to look at this magazine in comparison to the one that is ranked right above it in its category - The Economist.<br /><br />Both magazines download every week and you have the content ahead of anyone who might be waiting for the physical hard copy.  You can be done with next week's magazine before the weekend starts.<br /><br />Both have a fairly wide ranging look at the business world.  However, the Economist goes further in depth with regions that are not America.  There is a lot of content in the Economist, so much that it is almost hard to read cover to cover every week if you have other things you might want to read.<br /><br />BusinessWeek's brevity, in this light can be either a detriment or a selling point.  Most of the non-feature articles are around five hundred words.  There is even a greater way to save time, where the bottom of the article has a one-sentence synopsis called ""The Bottom Line"".  It is kind of reductive, but nice if you're pressed for time.<br /><br />A big drawback is the formatting.  There are no photos in BusinessWeek, nor are there any charts.  It is all text.  The Economist has some photos from the print edition, and as far as I know, all of the charts (Even if they are hard to read at times on the screen).<br /><br />The selling point is price.  The monthly price is about 30% of that which the Economist is asking for.  As much as I like the Economist, I am keeping my subscription to Business Week because of the premium and the less time I need to spend, even though I am not entirely comfortable with my choice, it feels like the best one.",1
AVF9FV7AMRP5C,1256428800,Great business weekly,"Every week, I look forward to receiving this magazine for its interesting feature articles. The first couple of pages in Businessweek provide a summary into current events that have occurred in the past week. Each issue features one or two articles that provide insight, and new idea into forces that will change the business environment. I love the coverage that Businessweek focuses on the emerging economies of China, and India.<br /><br />Hopefully, the recent sale of Businessweek to Bloomberg will bring the same quality that I have come to expect from this magazine.<br /><br />Pros<br />- In-depth feature articles<br />- Good summary of weekly news<br />- Moderate viewpoint<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not as analytical or data driven as the economist",1
A38AAPXSJN4C5G,1231632000,You Could Do Better,"After several years, I am giving up by BW subscription.  The magazine is getting pretty light - and reminds me more of USA Today than the New York Times.  The articles are pretty general and lack depth.  Additionally, the magazine is very US-centric and often limits global coverage. It is a good light read for US business news, and if you aren't looking for great depth, might be a good choice.  For my money, I would rather pay up for the Economist and Fortune.<br /><br />Update - 2014 - I received a complementary subscription of Bloomberg Business Week and it is much improved over the version I reviewed 6 years ago.  Much closer to the Economist - which is still my ""go to"" magazine.  I have therefore upgraded the review to 4 stars to reflect the improvement and encourage the BW editors to keep up the good work.",1

This is a nice twist from the everyday magazines and gives a first hand view into great artists, collections, news, and historical relevance of all forms of global art.<br /><br />I saw the other review talk about not enough subscribers- I would hate to see this leave the world for not enough subscriptions.<br /><br />I gift magazines subscriptions frequently because I love how they can inspire my loved ones month after month ( and they are a low cost gift).<br />I will frequently gift one at a unique turning point in someones life. This is one I love for art students, collectors, artists, and designers.<br />It does have in-depth articles that can get a little professor-ish BUT the splendid pictures are delish!<br />Overall this publication has a grown-up and solid feel.<br /><br />Try something new. It may inspire you to start visiting more artists.",1
A3NWN21HH5CEWZ,1198886400,my new favorite magazine!,"I highly recommend this magazine for working or stay at home moms. There is truly a little bit of everything.  Inexpensive fashion, makeup tips, healthcare, nutrition, fitness, relationships, family, etc... It doesn't prefer one to the other and there are useful tips jotted all over the place that are truly useful. There are very few ads in the magazine and the ones they do have usually come with useful coupons.  It seems to market young moms ages 25-40.  I am 31 and when this magazine comes in the mail, I honestly read it front to back.  No useless stories or expensive fashion that is out of my reach.  I just hope it stays as consistent and true to the market they are reaching.  Thanks All You!!!<br /><br />7/29/08 UPDATE:  I just reordered this for another 2 years.  This magazine is still great and I actually start thinking about when another issue will be hitting my mailbox which hasn't happened since I was a teen.<br /><br />Top 10 Favorite Parts:<br />1. Sudoku, Futoshiki, Crossword and Picture Puzzles in every issue<br />2. Table of Contents shows a picture of the front cover with page numbers for each tag - quick to flip to what interests you.<br />3. Easy layout to read. There are ordered sections called You Self, Your Health, Your World, Your Home, Seasonal, and In Every Issue.<br />4. Normal everyday people - no stick figure models in the this mag.<br />5. Fashion, decorating and make-up suggestions are all normal brands at normal stores (Target, Macy's, Gap, Walmart, Old Navy, LLBean, Pier 1)<br />6. Little fluff and most of the ads that are in there have coupons<br />7. Safe enough to leave on the table around kids (no kinky stuff)<br />8. Just enough family and kid-fun info but majority appeals to women so you don't feel so mommyish readying it<br />9. No gossip or celebrity picture.  I don't buy anything that pays scummy paparazzi.<br />10.  I can read it from beginning to end the first day and still go back to the issue multiple times thru the month for decorating, fashion and recipe ideas.  Great value<br /><br />I normally don't write long reviews but this is truly a great magazine!<br /><br />EDIT:  7/7/09 - BEFORE you order this magazine PLEASE look over the time it takes to get your first one in the mail.  Amazon states it takes 6 to 10 weeks from the day you purchase right at the top of the page.  All the 1 star reviews are from idiots who are mad their magazine hasn't come yet and ""it's been a whole month!""  Stop leaving poor reviews because it isn't All You's fault or Amazon's - it is your own fault for not reading the obvious print on how long it takes to arrive.  Be patient.  It is a great magazine and doesn't deserve the bad 1 star reviews for people's lack of common sense.<br /><br />EDIT: 7/5/13 - I still order and read this magazine every single month.  I think the content has stayed the same but I think there are a few less coupons than before.  The only place you can pick this magazine up in the stands is at Walmart.  And yes, it still takes a long time to get this magazine like every other magazine from Amazon.  You can get it a few weeks quicker going directly to their publishing department but I like the magazine subscription reminder thru Amazon as opposed to getting paper mail from publishers.  Earth friendly and easier to remember.",1

A3R7MXVQRGGIQ9,1439942400,An interesting and informative magazine for anyone who lives in the Midwest part of the country.,"My wife and I are voracious readers.  We read the papers every day, as well as books and magazines.  This magazine (Midwest Living) focuses on living in the Midwest but has articles and features that may be of interest to anyone no matter where you live in the U.S.  I just finished reading the June/July 2015 issue which had some interesting and informative articles and departments.  The following is just an example of the material in this magazine:<br />Notes of the North was about the beautiful music, art, and wilderness of the Apostle Islands in Bayfield, Wisconsin. Flower power showed some of the floral fabrics, wall papers and accessories that brighten up a home. Viva Mexican night gives 14 delicious recipes you can spice up your dinner time.  They also have shorter articles on travel, the Midwest life, discoveries, events worth writing for and reflections.  Even though this is a magazine that appeals to women more then men, it often has articles and features men might enjoy reading as well.  It is also reasonably priced at about $2.00 an issue when you subscribe.<br /><br />If you live in the Midwest you might want to check out this magazine.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J.

AMVC9WTXYKNJ1,1297468800,"A Better Value, but with some issues","You have to look at this magazine in comparison to the one that is ranked right above it in its category - The Economist.<br /><br />Both magazines download every week and you have the content ahead of anyone who might be waiting for the physical hard copy.  You can be done with next week's magazine before the weekend starts.<br /><br />Both have a fairly wide ranging look at the business world.  However, the Economist goes further in depth with regions that are not America.  There is a lot of content in the Economist, so much that it is almost hard to read cover to cover every week if you have other things you might want to read.<br /><br />BusinessWeek's brevity, in this light can be either a detriment or a selling point.  Most of the non-feature articles are around five hundred words.  There is even a greater way to save time, where the bottom of the article has a one-sentence synopsis called ""The Bottom Line"".  It is kind of reductive, but nice if you're pressed for time.<br /><br />A big drawback is the formatting.  There are no photos in BusinessWeek, nor are there any charts.  It is all text.  The Economist has some photos from the print edition, and as far as I know, all of the charts (Even if they are hard to read at times on the screen).<br /><br />The selling point is price.  The monthly price is about 30% of that which the Economist is asking for.  As much as I like the Economist, I am keeping my subscription to Business Week because of the premium and the less time I need to spend, even though I am not entirely comfortable with my choice, it feels like the best one.",1
AVF9FV7AMRP5C,1256428800,Great business weekly,"Every week, I look forward to receiving this magazine for its interesting feature articles. The first couple of pages in Businessweek provide a summary into current events that have occurred in the past week. Each issue features one or two articles that provide insight, and new idea into forces that will change the business environment. I love the coverage that Businessweek focuses on the emerging economies of China, and India.<br /><br />Hopefully, the recent sale of Businessweek to Bloomberg will bring the same quality that I have come to expect from this magazine.<br /><br />Pros<br />- In-depth feature articles<br />- Good summary of weekly news<br />- Moderate viewpoint<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not as analytical or data driven as the economist",1
A38AAPXSJN4C5G,1231632000,You Could Do Better,"After several years, I am giving up by BW subscription.  The magazine is getting pretty light - and reminds me more of USA Today than the New York Times.  The articles are pretty general and lack depth.  Additionally, the magazine is very US-centric and often limits global coverage. It is a good light read for US business news, and if you aren't looking for great depth, might be a good choice.  For my money, I would rather pay up for the Economist and Fortune.<br /><br />Update - 2014 - I received a complementary subscription of Bloomberg Business Week and it is much improved over the version I reviewed 6 years ago.  Much closer to the Economist - which is still my ""go to"" magazine.  I have therefore upgraded the review to 4 stars to reflect the improvement and encourage the BW editors to keep up the good work.",1

Gone are all the great articles about meditation, healthy mind-body, different yoga-related philosophies, etc.<br /><br />I wound up subscribing to ""Mindful Magazine"" instead and it's more of what I was looking for.

A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,1326844800,"Good for beginners, lots of ads...","First off.  I ordered this for $5 from amazon while on special.  Takes about 2-3 months to get the first issue (which it clearly states when ordering).<br /><br />There are some interesting articles, many intended for beginners.  Since the vast majority of yoga students are beginners, they are definitely hitting the target market.  But being a very advanced practitioner, I wasn't expecting too much from this magazine.  I was slightly surprised though from several of the peripheral articles.  That is, the articles not about the actual physical activity of yoga, but about the mind and lifestyle associated with.  Things like adding Feng Shui to your abode or tips for vacationing or improving wellness.<br /><br />That is why I actually give it some good stars.  The one less star than perfect is because this magazine has TONS of ads.  Lots.  And many are for companies and products that many yoga students could care less about... Though some are of interest.  I don't mind some Lululemon and Gaiam ads, but flip through one issue and you see that nearly 2/3 of the magazine is ad space...  But I guess that's where the money is.  Not in the $5 to $15 per year subscriptions.<br /><br />Also of note:  9 issues.  Not 12 for a year.  Just fyi.<br /><br />If you know what you're getting with this periodical, then it's a good thing to have.  Just don't be shocked that the poses mentioned are pretty basic, or some of the fundamentals are covered over and over again.  It's meant for the beginner.  I have a couple of books that have more advanced information and those are what I use for improving my alignment in poses:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Athlete-s-Guide-to-Yoga-An-Integrated-Approach-to-Strength-Flexibility-and-Focus/dp/193403004X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Athlete's Guide to Yoga: An Integrated Approach to Strength, Flexibility, and Focus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Optimal-Health-for-a-Vibrant-Life-A-30-Day-Program-to-Detoxify-and-Replenish-Body-and-Mind/dp/1451548435/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Optimal Health for a Vibrant Life: A 30-Day Program to Detoxify and Replenish Body and Mind</a>.

Every recipe I have tried to make out of this magazine has always turned out.

A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,1398556800,Makes Learning About Food Fun Again,"""Food Network Magazine"" is my favorite culinary periodical. I am a fan of some of the celebrity chefs on Food Network, and this magazine is good on covering them in interviews and showcasing their recipes and cooking techniques. The magazine is very hefty and is printed on high quality glossy stock; that combined with the first class photography inside makes readers motivated to improve their cooking game and try their hand at new dishes and methods.<br /><br />I'm a dedicated follower of Alton Brown, whose culinary creativity and methodologies are singularly amazing, and also love the food from Bobby Flay, Michael Symon, and Aarn Snchez (whose knowledge and use of spices and particularly peppers is without peer.) Honestly there are few of the chefs who I don't enjoy hearing from, and most issues are worth a solid cover to cover perusal. I like the visual elements of the magazine: the ""Recipe Index"" has a page number and photo of all the dishes in an issue, and the ""Star Search"" feature has pictures of the celebrities in an issue with the pages they appear on. There are many routine features that I love, but none as much as the well-illustrated recipes section. I particularly enjoy the ""You Asked"" section where the star chefs answer reader questions: sometimes these tips can prove extremely useful.<br /><br />I gave the magazine five stars though there are a few things less than perfect. The magazine, like most similar publications, has a ton of advertising, though much of it is relevant and unobjectionable. Each issue has a theme: normally this theme is a welcome centering device, but sometimes it is excessive as are some of the features. A recent edition had more coverage of deviled eggs than anyone could ever want (and I like deviled eggs,) while some of the articles are of little practical use (I'm not interested in Penn Jillette's colorful kitchen, for instance, though I am sure some readers are.) Regardless of these quibbles, I still greatly enjoy ""Food Network Magazine"" and look forward to every new issue. I recommend it to cooks (of all experience levels) and fans of Food Network everywhere.",1

A35W3JQYP0M655,1289347200,The Best Food Magazine..A Bargain,"I have been subscribing to The Food Network Magazine,(FNM) for almost a year now.  Down through the years I have subscribed to several cooking magazines, and for one reason or another have eventually let them drop.  Every one I know, or have subscribed too were bi monthly magazines that mostly contained some cute little departments in them that were fun to read, but mostly a whole lot of recipes.  True recipe magazines aren't a bad thing if you enjoy just holding something in your hand the old fashioned way, but if its really recipes only your after, the online world is absolutely infested with huge sites where that is all they have and do.  I just never felt I got enough beyond the recipes in the other magazines to ever make them worth keeping...<br /><br />FNM is a whole different periodical.  Its more like a trade journal of the food network, and culinary industry in general.  All done in a nice easy, fun to read, colorful and entertaining style.  Its like being on the inside of the food channel, back stage where for most of us that love the food network, always wish we could be in any event.  I think its pretty much safe to say if you love the food network, or just love cooking, you will find this magazine immensely entertaining.  Its full of behind the scenes glimpses of the personalities, sets, production, and operation of all the shows we love to watch, as well as interviews, informative information, and a good dose of humor as well.  It also has a nice set up of every month departments where you can ask your questions, get reviews on new books and equipment, and get loads of tips on just about every kind if food or cooking that you can imagine.  Finally, despite what some other reviewers have expressed here as it being short on recipes, FCM still packs a good number of them into every issue, (even more starting about 7 issues ago). They also spread the recipes out as to dispensing them pretty evenly among all the different stars that have shows.  Therefore if you favor a certain personality or show, you will find something from them regularly.  Personally one thing I love about this magazine as to its take on recipes is that they don't seem to concentrate so much of sweets and desserts.  Seems like every magazine and cookbook I have ever owned deems is necessary to have a whole section devoted to just desserts.  I much prefer more in the way of recipes for real food, which FNM does a good job of delivering.  The recipes I have actually gotten around to trying from its pages have all turned out to be delicious, as you might expect.<br /><br />Lastly there are two others things worth mentioning if your considering subscribing to this FNM, and doing it here on Amazon.  The first is that FNM is published 10 times a year, or 3 more times than all other cooking magazines I know.  I like the fact that it comes every month but two.  (And trust me, this is a slightly over size, thick magazine, not just a thin thumb through).  Finally, I originally subscribed to this magazine through one of those subscription service sites on the web that claims to always have the lowest prices around.  I paid $18 for my subscription, and as of this writing it is still going for that price online, while here on Amazon its currently $15.  A pretty good savings for what it is.  I not only highly recommend this fun entertaining and informative magazine, but I also recommend you buy it right here on Amazon. I certainly will be when my subscription renewal comes around. I am immensely enjoying my Food Network Magazine, and I really think you will like it too...",1

The magazine is more of the same.<br /><br />There's quite a few ads for gadgets and some articles that are also thinly veiled advertisements for kitchen utensils and fancy items. I understand that the magazine has to make money somehow. If you can ignore the advertisements (some obvious and others ""not so"" obvious), then I think this magazine is worth the subscription price, which is heavily discounted online.<br /><br />Still a pretty good buy and something that you don't have to be embarrassed to put out on your coffee table when friends come over.",1

I remember the times when I looked forward to reading it, when I spent 30-60 minutes on an issue, when the valuable information (I am a movie buff, and I don't watch TV or listen to pop music) was at least 50%, when I chose the DVDs in my Netflix movie queue based on their EW score. These guys used to be that good. Not anymore.<br /><br />Nowadays it's just another piece of pop garbage. My subscription ended in February, but they sent me a courtesy issue, which I have just finished reading... in the usual under 10 minutes. Jack of all trades, master of none. Full of gossip-level amateurish material. They are simply irrelevant for this generation X-er. If they continue the current trend, I foresee a fast fall into oblivion.",0
ABS2A1OWX5Q8,1423180800,The Entertainment Bible.,"The weekly bible of everything entertainment, from movies, TV, music , video games and books (among other things). I have been s subscriber for nearly 15 years and although I do not agree with many of their reviews, there is always something interesting to read in the magazine. The only thing that irks me a lot is their opinion that THE WALKING DEAD is the best TV show on the air since the invention of sliced bread. Any intellectual viewer will see that the characters come directly out of Stereotypes 101 and the plots are nothing but recycled George Romero and countless other zombie films, but they always manage to put a story or photo of the series in every issue. Whomever thought that this was the best show ever on TV really needs to watch more TV. Even the worst episode of THE X-FILES makes the best episode of THE WALKING DEAD look like the worst episode of WHO'S THE BOSS. Just because a TV show has taboo-breaking gore on it does not make it a great series. What about M*A*S*H, THE WIRE, THE SOPRANOS, ST. ELSEWHERE, OZ, JUSTIFIED, THE AMERICANS, GAME OF THRONES, AMERICAN HORROR STORY or any other good show that made or makes TV worthwhile? To EW, they are nothing but chickenfeed when put next to THE WALKING DEAD. Like I said, that is really my only complaint about the magazine, but it is enough of an annoyance whenever I see I cover on the zine devoted to the show (and there have been many!). They do have a good staff of writers and make me laugh every now and then, so I give them a pass when it comes to TWD. It's a great zine at a very affordable price if you have it renewed every year. You pay like $0.49 an issue. A real bargain.",1

It's a sort of a good mix of pop culture *plus* a teeny, tiny bit of gossip, but the *""interesting"" kind, meaning- you won't find out about Snooki's latest drama, but you will get the scoop on how a much anticipated Hollywood franchise might be headed for trouble.<br /><br />The best thing about EW is their coverage of upcoming movies, books, television, music, and stage, plus interesting articles on the business of entertainment- everything from in depth coverage of TV shows to an inside look at a much anticipated film to long interviews with directors, etc.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the magazine is that it's starting to get very web and tablet focused- meaning, the content of the magazine is slowly getting leaner and leaner, and on every other page there's a reminder to check the EW website or iPad edition for the rest of the features. I'm not happy about this- I really like it when they had about six or eight pages of movie reviews. I'm not happy that now it's four pages of movie reviews, and two of those pages are tiny ""one sentence"" reviews and charts. It's the same for books and television and other media, as well.<br /><br />Regardless, I still eagerly dive into every issue that pops into my mailbox, and out of all the magazines I start and drop subscriptions to, this is the only one I really consider ""necessary"".

It's straight-forward, doesn't try to sell me $500 kitchen candle holders, or talk about vacations in Tuscany and how we should all pop over there. (I'm eyeballing you, Rachael Ray.)  The magazine works very well with their website although you can use one without the other. I really enjoy, and am happy for, the ""From Our Kitchen"" comments on the recipes. Unlike some of the major cooking magazines I find myself trying out recipes from AllRecipes more often. These are recipes tried out by People, not just one celebrity chef of the moment. There are a variety of skill levels involved so there is something for almost everyone. If you are a cook who utilizes ingredients only found under the full blue moon while riding a unicorn and costs $20 per tsp., perhaps this is not the magazine for you.",1

A1PGC1GEBY9CZU,1455235200,Family Centered Recipes and a Magazine Loaded with Advertising,"Years ago my mother was one of the original ""editors"" of Taste of Home.  That said, anyone who wrote a recipe and had it published was considered an editor.<br /><br />This WAS a great magazine for the home cook.  Most of the recipes were kitchen friendly with ingredients and tools you would have in a decently stocked kitchen.  Something along the lines of smoked paprika might have been considered ""classy"" or even foreign.  Today, with Reader's Digest at the helm, it's a different magazine.  Gone are the days of no advertisements (subscriptions paid for the publishing and profit) and it is now filled with big glossy photos of food, kitchen and body related items that the publishers feel you cannot live without.  I, for one, can live without them.<br /><br />Having spend more than 20 years in the culinary business from the bottom of the chain to operator and now educator, I would occasionally use Taste of Home for a ""comfort food selection"".  These particular recipes would be given to the newest of the new cooks to prepare and have ready for service.<br /><br />Taste of Home still has decent recipes.  It isn't the friendly magazine that it once was.  It's part of a conglomerate that feels numbers are more important the quality.  I'll read it, but I no longer subscribe.",1

A3EPHBMU07LZ50,1320192000,The heart of Taste of Home is missing,"What made the original Taste of Home a good magazine was the sense of community and sharing. It was a magazine that captured the heart of North American cooks who submitted their tried-and-true recipes. Most, if not all, the recipes used ingredients found in most kitchen cupboards and were homey. The recipes were also easy to prepare.<br /><br />Between the recipes was folksy blurbs telling about different cooks and their approach to cooking.<br /><br />The magazine WAS a magazine that featured real home-style recipes.<br /><br />The current magazine is none of the above. I purchased the November 2011 issue and expected to find some good home-style Thanksgiving recipes. Instead I found few recipes for the upcoming holiday and the ones I found would probably be more at home at a ""gourmet"" type magazine.<br /><br />The Thanksgiving feature included the following recipes for the TOH menu:<br /><br />Roasted Parsnip and Pear Soup<br />Wilted Spinach Salad with Butternut Squash<br />Cranberry Ricotta Gnocchi with Brown Butter Sauce<br />Jalapeno Cranberry Sauce<br />Tangerine-Glazed Turkey<br />Spiced Pumpkin Custard Pie<br /><br />While all the recipes are fine, my family would not be happy eating this for Thanksgiving as they are not all that traditional.<br /><br />A typical Thanksgiving dinner for my family could include:<br /><br />Relish Tray<br />Roast Turkey and Dressing<br />Mashed Potatoes<br />Green Beans<br />Cranberry Sauce<br />Dinner Rolls<br />Pumpkin Pie, Apple Pie, Cranberry Bread<br /><br />Each year there may be a slight twists to the old favorites but the core ingredients remain the same.<br /><br />Finally, the magazine seems glossy and filled with ads. It's just not the same Taste of Home magazine of old including the missing spoon found on every cover.<br /><br />Do not recommend this magazine as the original magazine is gone.",1

I have a variety of small investments in the form of mutual funds and gold funds.  Fortune does not directly steer the way I do things.  I does, however, guide my intentions occasionally.  I have learned a great deal by reading this magazine.  Things aren't necessarily crystal clear but I get a good grasp on what I must do in order to stay afloat.<br /><br />Fortune magazine is well written.  Why it certainly deals with business, business is what keeps this country moving and that's where the money is and goes.  It's watching these deals, mergers, sales and bankruptcies that guide where I put my money and how much of it goes there.<br /><br />I do like this magazine.  For anyone who has concern for their future and eventual retirement - and that SHOULD be everyone - this magazine is a treasure trove.",1
A1IU9VPCBKZPE8,1406505600,Keeping up to Date with Business and the Economy,"I received this magazine as a packaged subscription with Money magazine. At first I figured I would just skim through the issues until the subscription ran out, but after reading the first issue, I was hooked. That was several years ago. I thought it would just be a lot of boring articles about business and that I wouldn't be interested. Quite to the contrary, in each issue I would find at least one or two articles on various businesses that I found quite interesting. For example, in the latest issue (July 21, 2014) there was an article on the future of Instagram and one on the visionary founder of HTC including some of the issues the company is facing; I found both these articles of pertinent interest to me.<br /><br />Fortune also covers many topics of interest to anyone concerned about the economy, financial markets, and interesting people. This particular issue had an article on how big time companies were moving their ""headquarters"" overseas to avoid paying taxes. There was much beneficial information on this ongoing problem and its causes - and a list of the top ten avoiders. There are also very thought-provoking commentaries by Alan Sloan, Sheila Bair, Beck Quick, Nina Easton, and others.<br /><br />Fortune provides a quick overview of what's going on in business, the economy, and the financial markets, and often times has some very interesting stories about prominent people or current issues. You can also get the digital version to read on a tablet if you have the paper subscription. That's a nice bonus.",1

The magazine has changed in size, layout, and target audience to the point where I feel I am NOT that demographic. The magazine has become aimed at the more wealthy members of society. The recipes are a bit repetitious or made with ""one shot"" ingredients, i.e. expensive ingredients that are hard to find. Ingredients used once then you are stuck with something you will never use again.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed to see Rachael Ray go off on tangents about her expensive vacations. It's disheartening to see her monthly product page filled with items like jeans that cost $150. I thoroughly enjoyed the start of the magazine, but I do feel ostracized by recipes I cannot afford to make or that include ingredients so unique that making the recipe costs a lot of money.

It's dessert-heavy (as are most) and too too many recipes call for something I don't keep on hand and wouldn't buy anyway. Artichoke hearts? Lemon grass? Fresh chard? REALLY?<br />Healthy and fun eating doesn't require fresh mango Vidalia chutney or seared Alaskan You've-Never-Heard-Of. If you love using unusual ingredients, making aoli, trying the newest thing, and have access to these ingredients, snap this up.

A281NPSIMI1C2R,1150502400,Artistic Design with Unique Features,"Spa Parties and T-shirts that say ""Delish"" are very much a part of Rachael's magazine complete with pullout recipe cards and travel features. The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.<br /><br />The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes.<br /><br />Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.<br /><br />What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.<br /><br />This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The ""Ask Rachael"" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).<br /><br />What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? ""What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?"" I'm always intrigued.<br /><br />If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

I really enjoy receiving around the holidays because it has so many beautiful pictures, tips and gift-giving ideas. You will find a recipe, tip or article in every issue that you will want to save.<br /><br />I also like that Woman's Day is not completely consumed with advertisements like a lot are.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.",1

If you want to follow trends, Gourmet is a great magazine.  If you DON'T live in NYC, Gourmet has mostly forgotten about you.  That, my friend, is why I give it only 3*.  As a culinary professional who worked from Miami up to the St. Lawrence River in Upstate NY, I had often read the magazine and wondered, sometimes not even quietly, why the writers and editors were so stuck on the City.  If you didn't life there, you didn't matter.  That was the basic philosophy.<br /><br />On the plus side, the articles were usually well written, the interviews decent and the recipes interesting.  The following of trends was usually spot on.  Yes, NYC DOES have a lot of restaurants and a lot of chefs.  It isn't, however, the only place in the universe much less the United States.",1

Their articles used to be about men and their hobbies, careers, travels, explorations, health, toys, etc., and it was worth reading.  Over recent years though they have gotten too political, liberal, and left wing.  I began to notice it when they took every opportunity to criticize President George W. Bush who was pretty manly and outdoorsy.  Then along came their idol obama who they drooled over in every issue,  They put him on the cover that stated Barack Obama, Jock in Chief (oh please), and then wrote about Barack Obamas Next Level Retirement of which the authors were jealous.  And then the people of America elected President Donald J. Trump and every single issue has at least one and often more negative comments about him.  Someday they might realize that all of their readers are not liberal snowflakes but I doubt it.  My subscription expires this month and that is it.  No more mens journal coming before my eyes.",0

A3JPFWKS83R49V,1526774400,Archaeology Magazine: One of the Best Magazines in Existence,"I have several magazines that I consult for my reading enjoyment and/or enlightenment. With most of them, I thumb through and focus only on articles that seem interesting, but there are a few magazines that seem to hit the mark so consistently that I read the almost the entire issue month after month. One good example of the latter is Archaeology Magazine.<br /><br />What sets this magazine apart from most others is the content itself. Yes, there are some cool illustrations but where Archaeology Magazine shines is with the articles themselves. They are packed full of fascinating information and they enrich your knowledge of history. And I don't mean refresh your knowledge- I mean enrich, because much of what you read here is going to involve historical facts you likely never heard before. I come away from every issue learning something brand new about a specific era in world history and the cultures that lived and thrived during that time.<br /><br />Archaeology Magazine has very few advertisements. Most of them are clustered at the end of each issue, so you get uninterrupted reading from start to finish. Another thing I love is that most of the articles are not excessively long. Some are only a half- page or less. At most, they might cover four pages tops. I like this, because Im the type who may not want to commit to a long, say, 10 page magazine article. I read some magazine with long articles like this and the moment I see that its going to be this long- and I always check before I start reading- I often skip the article completely.<br /><br />Yet another reason to love Archaeology Magazine is the quality of the writing. The editors make sure each article is clear and concise, with proper grammar and clarity. The articles are educational and they maintain an academic style. Youre not going to find much in the way of humor or other creative forms of non- fiction prose. No, Archaeology Magazine sticks with the facts and presents them in and informative way that archaeology and history enthusiasts will appreciate.<br /><br />I usually skim through most magazines, but Archaeology Magazine is different. It is one of the very few magazines that maintain my interest from beginning to end, with every article worthy of a read. Try this magazine for yourself, and get enlightened on the fascinating world we live in and all of its glorious past.",1
